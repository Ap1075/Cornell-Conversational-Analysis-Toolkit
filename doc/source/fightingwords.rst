Fighting Words
==============

Based on `Monroe et al.'s Fightinâ€™ Words: Lexical Feature Selection and Evaluation for Identifying the Content of Political Conflict <http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Monroe.pdf>`_.

Implementation adapted from `Jack Hessel's implementation <https://github.com/jmhessel/FightingWords>`_.

Identifies the fighting words of two groups of utterances, which we define as the groups: 'class1' and 'class2'

Example usage: `finding the fighting words of r/atheism and r/Christianity <https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/convokit/fighting_words/demos/fightingwords_demo.ipynb>`_.
