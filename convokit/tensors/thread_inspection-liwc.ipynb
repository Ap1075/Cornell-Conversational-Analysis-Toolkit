[ireland is down to *only* 78% catholic](<url>) (plus there are other forms of christianity as well) from 84% just 5 years ago. so, still heavily catholic. 2. [poland is 87.2% catholic](<url>) plus other forms of christianity. 3. chile is harder to explain.

my intent was that they say the same thing. if they don't, i worded one of them badly. my intent with both statements (now wording it a third way) is to say that your religious beliefs should not be imposed on others. perhaps you see this now as also not quite the same. > and i'm not saying that either of these are wrong (though it seems like at least one is if they're nonidentical), but i dislike the implication that the issue is as simple as an aphorism. if it were simple, it wouldn't be a major topic of political conversation. well, it's less simple because there are dominionists today who believe that christianity should rule the world. never mind that christianity is not one thing. there are also other religions that tell people they have a right and moral responsibility to tell people who are not of their religion how to act. when one person's religion tells them that god hates fags and they must legislate to take rights away (or keep rights away) from homosexuals, then their freedom of religion is indeed impacted because they are not constitutionally allowed to take people's rights away (even though they often successfully do so). if one person's religion tells them they should dress a certain way (as, for example, the haredi jews do) and someone who is not of their religion does not dress conservatively enough for them, they do not have the right to actively harass that person. but, they still do so. and, if you tell them they can't, then they think you're taking away their freedom of religion. > now, the answer to the issue might end up being simply stated, if the answer is some decision rule that tells us the conditions of when someone is entitled to act on their religious beliefs. i believe it can be. yes. consider that the golden rule is incredibly simple. and, it covers things quite well because it automatically changes with the times. > but even then, i don't think this would make the matter simple, since exactly how we arrive at that rule, and what justifies it, will be complex topics. agreed. the question asked by the op was about how to view the issue. i think i gave a fairly concise way to word it that can be used as a lens through which to check each individual issue. then we can discuss, well, is that really a person exercising their own freedom of religion or is that case imposing their religion on others? >> do you think the pharmacist who refuses to fill prescriptions is not impacting the lives of those who need their prescriptions filled? > > obviously so, but the question is not whether there is impact, but whether the pharmacist should be obligated to act against what they hold most dear. ok. well, to take another example that might make it clearer, let's make the pharmacist someone with a new age religion/spirituality. remember, they have gone to college for pharmacology. they have accepted employment as a professional practitioner of medical science. but, their new age religion causes them to believe in the power of crystals. so, i go into the pharmacy with my prescription for humalog (insulin) because i actually am (in real life) a type 1 diabetic. the pharmacist instead of filling my prescription talks to me about the power of crystals. s/he shows me a quite beautiful amethyst crystal. i'm impressed. i like amethyst. but, i've already got one and it has never helped with my blood sugar. i explain that and demand that as a practitioner of medical science they fill my prescription for insulin. the manager is called over. it is explained to me that the pharmacist does not believe in modern medicine and cannot, according to his/her moral conscience fill a prescription for medication. they point me in the direction of the pharmacy in the next town over. when i hear that a pharmacist will not fill a valid medical prescription because of their religious beliefs, my reaction is the same as with the pharmacist with new age crystals. we go to medical practitioners expecting them to practice medicine. we don't want witch doctors! i understand that there are aspects of certain jobs that go against certain religions. if your religion does not allow you to perform your job, you have probably chosen the wrong profession. >> do you not think that the baker who discriminates against same sex couples is infringing on their rights through that discrimination? > > i think it depends. i've found most compelling accounts that draw the line where custom work is involved, such that it would be permissible to refuse to do a design but impermissible to simply bake a cake with nothing indicative on it. i see the same issue. restaurants can refuse service to customers who come in barefoot and shirtless. bars can refuse alcohol to someone who is already too drunk. but, neither can discriminate against classes of people. restaurants can not hang out signs that say \"no blacks\". that is illegal discrimination. the lens i use to answer the question is whether the person is practicing their religion or imposing their beliefs on others. no one is requiring the pharmacist to *use* birth control, only to fill all valid prescriptions *for use by others*. it's the job they signed up to do.\n",

      "                    17. \u001b[1mJohnTesh\u001b[0m: incorrect. dividends are paid after tax, so whether they pay them or not has nothing to do with tax avoidance. additionally, dividends have little to no impact on the market cap of a company like amazon. on top of all of that, amazon does not pay dividends at all, they invest their cash back into themselves to grow. this strategy reduces profit, and the growth drives up their market cap and drives down their cost of capital as a result.\n",

      "                            19. \u001b[1mJohnTesh\u001b[0m: i think that author does a disservice by writing such seemingly sensible articles without actually knowing how things work. if i didn't know better, i would think this guy was teaching me something. it's a shame he did not do research before he started writing. let's say you buy a classic car. you take super good care of it, all original, mint condition. you paid cash for it out of your savings. this is a balance sheet transaction that has nothing to do with income. you traded your cash asset for a classic car asset. now let's say this car is so rare and you keep it in such good condition that it gains value every year. maybe it was worth <cur>15k when you bought it, but this year it's already worth <cur>17k. great job on making a great purchase! but is that <cur>2k gain counted as income to you? no, it is not. the value of that asset on your balance sheet went up, but you did not make anything off of that increase in value because you have not sold it. if you had to pay taxes on the increase in value every year, those taxes would essentially force you to sell that car to pay the taxes just because you took care of it. additionally, in the long term, no one would want to own anything, so this would destroy the value of everyone's stuff, but i digress. in this example, amazon stock is the car. the author is seeing the increase in stock value adding to the balance sheets of the investors who bought the stock and confusing that with income. back to our example, let's say your car increased in value <cur>2k a year for two years and you decide to sell it for <cur>19k - now we are about to realize some income! since you bought it for <cur>15k and sold for <cur>19k, you earned an income of the difference, or <cur>4k. your income wasn't <cur>19k, because you originally put <cur>15k in cash into the car. that cash was already saved from income you made in the past, and it is not counted again as income in this sale. because you did not work for this new car sale income, but it was derived from asset growth, the income is called capital gains. you invested your capital (<cur>15k) into the asset (car), and that asset appreciated. when you sold it, you received capital (money) back in exchange for that asset. the capital you received is more than what you invested, which is to say you gained <cur>4k of capital by investing in and then selling your asset (car). because you held the car for two years, you qualify for lower long term capital gains tax rate on that <cur>4k. had you sold it after year 1, you would've paid your regular normal income tax rate on those capital gains. either way, you owe the tax when you sell the asset, not when it appreciates. i'm sure you realize this already, but if we change the car to amazon stock in my story, this is exactly how it works with investors. the author gets several things wrong 1 - amazon profits are not passed through to shareholders for income tax purposes. if amazon paid dividends, those dividends would be taxed at payout at the long term capital gains rate, and they would be paid out of cash amazon has left after it already paid corporate taxes on profits. amazon has decided they can add more value to investors by using cash to grow instead of paying dividends. when the investors sell the stock, they will owe capital gains on the growth of that stock. if amazon is correct that using cash to grow, then investors will effectively pay more when they sell the stock than they would pay today if dividends were paid. 2 - asset appreciation is not income. those investors will realize the income when they sell the stock, and they will pay the tax then. 3 - he is missing the point entirely on why amazon runs a low profit or how business strategy translates into financials. low prices are not a function of low profitability. low profitability could be an adverse result of low pricing, but being low profit in order to be low price is a ridiculous and failing strategy. amazon's low pricing is a function of their unparalleled buying power, unparalleled consumer and product data, amazing logistics prowess, clever loyalty programs like amazon prime, and many other brilliant things they've done. their low profitability is a function of their investment in things like amazon fresh, amazon alexa, drone delivery, automated convenience stores, building out cloud computing infrastructure, and many other r&d projects, <cur>4 billion in original content spending for amazon prime video, and all kinds of expenditures years ahead of when they become profitable. by the time consumers want it, amazon already built it three years ago - this is the power of amazon. sometimes multi billion dollar experiments fail, and all that money was for nothing. sometimes they lose money for a few years and then become the infrastructure that runs a third of the internet. amazon does not let fear of failure stop them, they invest in growth with their cash. this is how bezos thinks - how do we build the future, not how can i avoid tax i do need to make a disclaimer here - there could be special tax treatment of classic cars that makes my example not work. also classic cars may not appreciate in value. i don't know anything about classic cars, i just picked a politically neutral thing to put in my story and made some assumptions to illustrate how capital gains work. my story is definitely how stocks work, and probably cars, but i just want to point out that i don't know shit about car collecting.\n",

      "            13. \u001b[1mpotatokid07\u001b[0m: be honest with her. say if you really need time off to get rid of that feelings. it might take months or years, but if she's a good friend she will wait. she might cannot tahan getting nc-ed, but it's for your own and her good. tell that whenever you feel ready, you will tell her. make a promise with her as friends. it takes courage and faith for everything.\n",

      "        14. \u001b[1mTELL_ME_I_AM_EGG\u001b[0m: alright i do agree with you i did manipulate her to a certain extent and i know it was wrong. yes certain things i did, was so that she would be in a relationship with me. however later on into the \"relationship\" i did try to better myself for her. on some days when she needed space i did give her time to rest and left her alone. no texting or meeting up for a certain period. no one will believe me but the day that i guilt tripped her i just was not mentally stable and didn't help that i was sick, i really didn't know what i was doing that day. also the reason why i told her how badly the rejection is affecting me was because she was the only person that i trusted and honestly i did tell her that i am sorry that i am a selfish person. i just don't know what should i do\n",
      "            15. \u001b[1mmeowmaocat\u001b[0m: then believe what you told her and man up to your feelings and your actions, don't look for pity and validation on the internet. go speak to a counsellor or go out and find new things to do than just fap and reddit, like take a few hikes or go to the gym for the first time. edit to add - you need help. if you are truly mentally unstable or whatever, there are several resources like twinkle friends and support communities on reddit (like r/offmychest or r/welistentoyou) where you can find more information and resources to find help. there is no shame in admitting that you need help to deal with your feelings and understand why your actions were inappropriate.\n",

      "                    8. \u001b[1mstop_the_broats\u001b[0m: the greens should have understood that an ounce of political pragmatism is worth a pound of ideological purity. the greens represent about 10% of voters and despite promises to be the next big thing, seem to be consistently stuck at about 10% of the vote. in a democracy, solutions need to be politically viable. the greens trade off presenting ideologically pure but politically unviable solutions. the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.\n",

      "        4. \u001b[1mawkwardbabyseal\u001b[0m: the tldr up front: i have no idea still how to manage the idea that an nparent may be an nparent because they were also emotionally and physically abused for most of their adult life. how can i distance myself for the sake of my sanity knowing that my nmom's inability to understand personal boundaries stems from her lifetime of being isolated and not being allowed to interact with anyone but her own children? ____________ the context: i've been grappling with this exact question over the past year as i've been going increasingly lc with my mom. like there are times when she'll do something genuinely nice for me, or there will be times when i think back and remember points when she seemed genuinely nurturing (like when i was sick as a kid), and i question if i'm just twisting her into this monster of a person that she really isn't. have i found this sub and am now just trying to apply what i'm reading from other people to make it fit with my own experiences? am i making my past or my current experiences with my mom seem worse than they really are? but then i think about how much emotional off-loading mom would do with me (i was like her best friend and personal therapist since i was in middle school), and how she just makes so many time demands of me whether it's calling me about some random thing and keeping me on the phone for an hour and a half, or how she expects me to just drop whatever i'm doing because i'm \"the only one she can count on\" to help her with whatever. she has incredibly porous boundaries, and when any of us kids have tried to set more firm personal boundaries, she makes it a point to say, \"i'm *trying* not to take it personally,\" like it's an unreasonable amount of emotional labor for her to do to allow her grown children to have lives of our own outside our interactions with her. my interactions with my fiance and his family have also shifted my perspective on what is actually reasonable between a parent and child - like, my soon to be mil is so chill. (she actually asks how i'm doing and then listens to my answers. she pays attention to my interests so she can find beappropriate birthday or christmas gifts...unlike my mom, who just buys things she likes band gets mad at me if i dont enthusiastically receive them. she is happy to just see us if we stop by to say hello and doesn't use that visit as an excuse to make us do manual labor while we're there.) i have to keep checking in with my fiance whenever i interact with my mom because i'm so use to her demands that i need my fiance to actively remind me that \"it's reasonable for you to react negatively to this thing your mom is doing.\" he sees how i become this lifeless robotic shell of a person when i'm around her because i've started mentally blocking out most of what she says, and i just go through the motions to get through the interaction. he hates seeing me like that because he knows how much pain it must cause me to now defensively repress these memories of being around my mom. i'm in this weird middle perspective between two of my older siblings - one who literally thinks our mom is mentally unstable and needs to be put in a home (mom isn't even 70 yet), and the other sibling who keeps justifying her behavior as \"loneliness\" and \"lack of structure\" since mom has been widowed for the past six years and \"retired\"(disabled) for closer to ten years. our mom was the victim of two abusive marriages,and she literally hasn't lived independently her entire life until now. got married when she was 19. she hasn't had any long-term close friends because of her husband's isolating her, so her kids became the next best thing because as dependents we had no escape until we graduated high school. like... i get it. i understand parts of *why* she is the way she is. i was talking to my sil recently abut some dumb crap my mom did and how angry it made me, and my sil (who has felt constantly at odds with my mom because mom privately describes my sil as \"the woman who stole her son from her\") said, \"if it's any comfort, i'm sure she doesn't mean to cause you this grief.\" no, it really doesn't make me feel better. i know she doesn't always intend to cause grief - the fact that she's so oblivious to how she makes me feel like a pawn or a part of her scenery infuriates me more because that means she believes that's my role as a person and her daughter... to just do whatever she demands of me. this whole idea of understanding why mom is the way she is, especially given the ties to domestic abuse, makes it hard for me to say she has nbehaviors because on some level i think that her being a victim of that violence means her behavior isn't fully her fault. she doesn't know what's normal. still, i can't allow myself to think she's blameless because she continues these patterns of behavior that put her at the center of everything regardless if that impinges on the well-being of her family or friends. i just hate the duality of being endlessly pained by someone i also care about.\n",

      "                11. \u001b[1mawkwardbabyseal\u001b[0m: oh, goodness. don't apologise for rambling. you see how long my comment was! that bit about being \"part of the scenery\" only clicked recently for me. my mom broke her ankle this winter, so while she was in a cast she needed help running errands and getting to doctor appointments. any of the time i spent with her, she just doesn't stop talking. this is how it's always been. it's the worst when we're in the car because there's no escape. she even made a crack recently that my sister turns up the radio to signal that she wants mom to shut up, which i found funny because i've used that same tactic with mom since high school, and she just talks louder over the music. it would be one thing if it were a conversation, but it rarely is. she'll keep talking and talking, and the only time she asks questions if it's something she feels she needs to know to keep her monologue going. she won't even remember who was with her for certain events - just that *someone* was there, and it doesn't matter what that person had to push aside to be there to help her in that moment. i went to therapy for the first time last spring, and i set myself the task during my mother's day outting with my mom to see how long it would take her to ask me how my life was going. we were together for four hours, and it took her until around two hours into that to ask me directly how my life was going. in that previous time, she talked about her doctor appointments, her neighbors, my oldest (delinquent) brother, my older sister, her grandkids (and how she doesn't see them enough for living in the same town), and all these new pseudo-scientific rememdies she aims to try for her numerous ailments. when she did finally ask me how i was doing, i gave her a very flat, non-specific answer, she seemed satisfied, and then immediately went back to talking about things relating to her. after that, i felt so hollow that i even forgot that afternoon event happened until a month later when my mom complained she hadn't seen me in forever. i kept thinking, \"was it easter? has it been that long? i feel like it hasn't been *that* long...\" because it wasn't. i completely blocked out that whole mother's day meal with her, and apparently she didn't remember it either.\n",

      "                12. \u001b[1mawkwardbabyseal\u001b[0m: you're welcome. thank you for reading. i think the duality of it is especially different because i'm the type of person who tries to see the human side of even people i dislike. it's easy to cut someone off if you've already written them off or see them as enemies or monsters. by accepting their faults as human, i'm leaving myself open to the fact that i can also display those types of behaviors or tendencies because i am also human...and the one thing i don't want to do is think that i am capable of causing someone else the pain my nrelatives have caused me. it was really easy for me to go nc with my birth father because my entire life i disliked even the minimal contact i had with him. with my mom, i spent me entire growing life with her, and she did fulfil some kind motherly needs...but she also was/is an emotional needy person. she still demands i provide her that life purpose even now that i'm grown. i still care about her, but it's not healthy to be her \"everything\" - her daughter, her best friend, her emotional partner. she wants that from all her kids, and she says she feels hurt that we won't include her in our lives to the capacity she expects we should. it's harder to out distance between me and her because i still care about her well-being...i just want my own life space.\n",
      "            9. \u001b[1mbanshee_hands\u001b[0m: a lot of what you've written is very similar to my life & my relationship with my own mother. she was a product of an extremely abusive home as a child. it makes everything so much harder to figure out. on the one hand, my mom made the conscious choice to not physically abuse my sister and i. she knew that had negatively affected her and her siblings growing up and didn't want to do that to her own children. she also moved very far away from her family because several of them were sexual predators, and she did not trust any situation in which they may have had easy access to us. on the other hand, my mom has zero understanding of personal boundaries and basically treats us as extensions of herself. we were used as her personal therapists constantly. she has a poor handle on recognizing and dealing with her anxiety, so things that she was merely anxious about were told to us as fact. it's been almost thirty years and i'm only just now beginning to uncover what was actually true and what was her paranoia. she often puts us down, or disagrees with our opinions without attempting to understand or even listen. she's also extremely critical (even in situations that don't call for it), is a control freak, and can be very verbally/emotionally abusive. when any of this is pointed out to her, she rationalizes her behaviors by saying that it was nowhere near as bad as what she dealt with as a child. i know she genuinely loves and cares for us. she put in a lot of effort as a parent, especially when we were children. the majority of the abusive things she did started around when i was 10; before that, she was a pretty great parent. i have empathy for her and her situation. i have a fairly easy time understanding it at this point. she was not brought up well, and she's so emotionally crippled she's not capable of relating to us in healthy ways. i think she wanted children in part to prove she could do better than her own parents. and she has. but that's a pretty low bar, and what she did was still abuse and still fucked us up.\n",
      "                13. \u001b[1mawkwardbabyseal\u001b[0m: it's unfortunate that you had to endure such and upbringing. our situations do sound very similar. the emotional clinginess and dependency. all of it. my mom insists that everything she did was for the good of us kids, and she reluctantly admits that she's made bad choices along the way. i understand she was given an impossible task - she fled her first abusive marriage to move us four kids (between the ages of 2-16) out of state, and for another decade she still had to deal with our birth father refusing to pay child support, poisoning her own siblings against her, and then taking jabs at her whenever he could by sending her old belongings to us kids as holiday and birthday gifts. mom never dissuaded us from talking to our father because she wanted us to have the choice to judge his character for himself. the funny thing is that two of us heard more of mom's side of the story and side more firmly with her as an abused wife when the other two heard more of our father's story, which paints mom as a cheating homewrecker. (the truth is usually somewhere between both perspectives?) having escaped all that, mom went back to school, became a nurse, and then remarried a man who ended up being a self-loathing, self-pitying, alcoholic who emotionally abused us both (i was the only one of her kids too young to move out). i begged her to kick him out because he was making us both afraid to come home. she said we couldn't afford to lose his income. i said i'd take up a part time job. she didn't see that as an option. mom always said her greatest fear was her kids \"deciding to leave before it was the *rightful* time\"...as in us moving out before college. i threatened to move in with my brother and his wife before my senior year of high school. i wrote her a fourteen page letter explaining how i felt about our situation, how depressed i was,and how the prospect of continuing to live in this fear my stepdad created made me seriously contemplate suicide. either he had to leave, or i would leave. my mental health couldn't handle it anymore. mom convince my dad to go to rehab saying that i hated him. he went to rehab, he came back two months later, and things were quiet before he started drinking again and started his belligerant tirades. i was almost done with school and just had to wait until i could go away to college. four years later, i graduate, and i convince mom that she needed to move away from our stepdad. i legitimately thought it would be better for her to move to where my brother and i would be living because her home was in an incredibly rural area with few resources, and her health was declining to the point where she wouldn't be able to maintain a house by herself (keep in mind, i did a majority of the labor around the house while i lived there while mom would sleep her days away and my stepdad would call me lazy from the kitchen table, where he spent his days watching daytime tv, drinking beer and playing solitaire). i guess i shot myself in the foot with that suggestion because after my stepdad died of an aggressive cancer, mom now expected us nearby kids to spend all our free time with her because we were all she had. we all actually see each other more now than we ever did when we lived in different states (like once or twice every other month as opposed to once or twice a year), but the fact that we live within ten miles of each other now (my mom and sister literally live in the same low income partment complex) creates that proximity fallacy that suggests we should be spending even more time together. my mom had two health scares this winter, and i spent two months helping her throughout the week and even missing work on several occasions to care for her, and it just gave this insight into what the future could look like. she's been grooming me to be her caretaker since i was twelve, and she listed me as her power of attorney last year. she fully expects me to buy a house with an in-law room or apartment so she can live with me and i can take care of her. the three days i took off work to help her during her health scare this winter left me so emotionally drained that i refuse to make that a long-term commitment. i will die. i just can't.\n",
      "            14. \u001b[1maloysiusxl\u001b[0m: yes!! that is exactly how i became around my mom. a shell of myself. i would sit there with my arms crossed not talking because she didn't want to hear what i had to say and there was no point trying to communicate with her. then i would get mad and sullen and would feel guilty later. i know what you mean about being around a \"normal\" mother... as a kid i had a friend whose mom was cool. she would make us scrambled egg sandwiches with mayo which i thought were the best thing in the world! she would take us to rent a movie. we would play boggle. the simplest things but to me it was such a joy to be in that home and to be seen and feel valued. i've done the same thing... i know my mom can't help how she was in a lot of ways because her mother was abusive to her. but... did she really try her best?? i don't think she did. the more she was able to get away with selfish and controlling behavior without anyone standing up to her, she became kind of a tyrant. that's on her.\n",
      "                19. \u001b[1mawkwardbabyseal\u001b[0m: one of my coworkers has two kids - 9 and 13 i think, and i'm inwardly jealous of how good of a mom my coworker is with her kids. she just had a p/t conference with her oldest kid's teachers, and her teachers praised her like, \"you're doing so well with them. they're engaged in the class material, they're kind and patient with the other students, and they're active with their extra curriculars.\" she tried to brush it off like she just got lucky with getting good kids, and the teachers were like, \"oh, no. it's not just luck. parents play a huge role in child development... a lot of how they are is because of you.\" she's shared some of her concerns with me about how she's so worried she's not a good enough mom, and i've told her that i would have loved to have had her as a mom. she recently got divorced from her abusive husband, and everything she did was an act of keeping her kids safe and providing them a normal and stable environment. she made tough calls and really cut back because of a tighter budget on a single income, but her kids always came first. she vowed to never expose her kids to that kid of abuse again. i wish i had that growing up...that feeling like my mom cared about my interests and my personal physical and emotional safety. my mom went through all that same stuff, and her choices were just so different. her whole aim was to make sure the household was \"provided for\" monetarily, and if that meant staying with her second abusive husband show she could share in his ss and disability checks, then that's what she was going to do. even after i begged her to put our emotional health first - i would gladly work an after school job to help pay for our mortgage if it meant we would not fear what kind of shitstorm we might come home to. honestly, my stepdad dying back in 2012 was the biggest relief because we just wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. my mom managed to find an even shittier boyfriend that year while i was splitting an apartment with her, and that was the year that broke whatever good bonds we had. dad had just died, and i was dealing with the complicated grieving process of that. mom's creep bf makes some sexually inappropriate comment towards me, i curse him out of the apartment, and mom in her confusion looks at me dazed, doesn't back me up, and literally rides off into the night with this jerk on his motorcycle. chose another abuser over her daughter. i was done. it's broken. it's been five years of me going increasingly lc, and i can't say i want to try to fix our relationship. mom says stuff like, \"i've learned to forgive myself for my mistakes so i can leave the past in the past.\" no attempts to be more aware of how she affects other people with her decisions. we just have to take it or leave it. i'm leaving it in that case.\n",
      "            18. \u001b[1maloysiusxl\u001b[0m: another thought. maybe instead of thinking of your mom as all one way or the other... such as completely unable to help herself due to her history or completely narcissistic by choice... maybe sometimes she is unable to help herself and sometimes she could have made a better choice. there are times probably when her past make it hard for her to do anything other than narcissistic behavior. but there are other times when she is making a conscious choice to be difficult or mean. ultimately, the reason why she is the way she is isn't your responsibility. if she's making you sad and angry and upset, you have the right to protect yourself from that. i was neglected as a kid. but i made the choice to go into therapy and try to get better. i was in an abusive relationship but i read a bunch of books about it and went to therapy and vowed not to be in a relationship like that again. it's hard! not everybody has the inner or outer resources. my point is that if people really wanted to change though, they could. must aren't willing.\n",
      "                20. \u001b[1mawkwardbabyseal\u001b[0m: thank you for your thoughts :) when i ended my last stretch of therapy (need to find a new therapist), i came to the resolve that i can't control my mom's actions or words,but i can choose how to react to them and i can choose whether or not to engage at all. like you said, how she lives her life isn't my responsibility. i'm mainly trying to hold my ground to make sure she doesn't pressure me into letting her life be my responsibility. she's such a dependent person, and she's fond of using the \"i'm your mother\" guilt to get what she wants. it's hard to assert a firm standing with someone who raised you to have as porous boundaries as she has.\n",
      "    5. \u001b[1mTerminalParalyze\u001b[0m: everyone who has been abused by their so could tell you stories of how wonderful their spouse is now and then. they are the most sweet and generous people...and then they begin to be less sweet, less caring and more annoyed every day, and victim can feel the noose tighten around their neck and they just hope that the blowup would happen soon because the anxiety and fear is too much, and then the spouse beats them to hospital and the cycle restarts from the spouse being loving and caring and so so sorry. i believe every abuser keeps this cycle on. even if it is just angry words we are talking about. everyone gets angry now and then, gee, it is not long ago i yelled at a surgeon who messed up my top surgery just from sheer ignorance and now i have to retake it and it pisses me to no end. but for real abusers it is a pattern, and you can count on it. lets take an example of a co-worker who is verbally abusive and all kinds of pain in the arse to work with. they come to work and have \"a bad day\" again, so they snap at you, belittle you and use you as a verbal punching bag for the whole day. then they go home and now they feel better as they have managed to load their shit to other people for a while. they have an unconcious fear that how they acted might backfire. maybe someone will go and speak to a boss, or at least, people might talk behind their back. so next day they come to work and are now extra careful to be extra polite and friendly to everyone. they might even go an extra mile to please others. peace and quiet goes on for few days, until they again have \"a bad day\" and they make everyones life a living hell. never, ever believe that abuser doesn't have their own best interest in being nice. maybe your mother had a moment when she wanted to look like a good mother in her own eyes, and good mothers (in her mind) sing lullabies. who knows. i believe it was self-serving.\n",
      "        16. \u001b[1maloysiusxl\u001b[0m: thank you so much for this reminder! i was in an abusive relationship and i volunteer at our women's shelter. i absolutely know this to be true about abusive male/female relationships but i had never really thought about it in terms of my mother. they're probably was a cycle of being nice, ramping up, blowing up, then going back to being nice again.\n",
      "        17. \u001b[1maloysiusxl\u001b[0m: and yes. i think there is something to what you say about \"being a good mother\". i remember one time she sat us down to write letters to her aunt. she had all these crazy anorexic aunts and she was obsessed with them. i had never even met these women. she told me to write that we were sorry our fingers were greasy on the paper - it was because mom made us hot buttered popcorn we were eating while we wrote the letters. even as a seven-year-old i thought that was a weird thing to write! she wanted to paint a picture for her aunts of her being this great mom who makes popcorn. i do think she wanted to be a good mom. and she did try in some ways. i think she never wanted to have kids, though, but she was expected to as a young wife in the 1960s. i think there was definitely a part of her that tried but she did not love herself enough to be able to love anyone else. and she got more neurotic over time. maybe there were moments where she did sing us lullabies and she was being a loving mother. but then when we cried or had needs or got in fights and we became terrible kids again.\n",

      "1. \u001b[1mlazergoespewpew\u001b[0m: the big diffference between battery powered trucks and h2 fuel cell trucks is uptime. in an application where downtime costs you money, then you need a product that allows you to continuously operate 24/7. battery packs must be swapped out and recharged. i can only make assumptions here, but a battery truck would have to a) pull into the service depot and sit to be recharged. this is extremely expensive (all that investment just to have the truck sit for hours? no way.), so really the truck would have its battery pack swapped out and recharged while a freshly charged battery is put in place. this is labor intensive and requires a team of technicians to perform (not to mention space needed for storing/charging batteries, which is another cost consideration where real estate is limited). not to mention the cost of spare batteries needed to run one truck continuously. performance characteristics of batteries (lead acid in particular) lead to performance droop over time, so you cannot operate at max load-the truck will only slow down as the battery discharges. fuel cells operate at max load all the time. they take minutes to fill their h2 tanks. yes, they require an h2 infrastructure on-site, but it has been proven cost effective over battery charging stations, especially for customers where utilities cost a premium (maine, for instance). the downside to fuel cells is reliability. it's a relatively new technology and there are growing pains associated with that. specifically due to the cost (money and carbon footprint) of h2 gas. but with most industries (ex. lithium ion battery production following the smart phone boom), supply will eventually keep up with demand. source: i'm a field service engineer for a hydrogen fuel cell company that specializes in forklift applications.\n",
      "    2. \u001b[1mseanmg\u001b[0m: the only thing that you got wrong is the swapping of cells. that's been a discussed thing with it being automated and taking just a couple of minutes, no people. at least that's the theory/intention that was out out a year or so ago by musky-poo.\n",

      "        17. \u001b[1mlazergoespewpew\u001b[0m: even if battery swaps are automated, this still cuts into uptime performance and requires multiple (expensive) batteries to be purchased for a single truck. then you have an automated battery swap product that will needs servicing. complex problem for sure. fuel cells are a viable solution here. i like musky-poo, but his statements on fuel cells are wrong. it's in his best interests as a battery salesman to say what he says.\n",

(this is what fc passenger cars do, at least.) i feel like i have to also mention that hydrogen is a terrible energy storage option if you're interested in reducing carbon emissions--dozens of specific physical reasons covered elsewhere. and even apart from carbon, the end to end efficiency is stunningly bad even in the best case.\n",

(this is what fc passenger cars do, at least.) it absolutely makes sense in motive applications where vehicles have a centralized fueling depot. musk can talk trash about 'fool cells' all he wants because he sells battery cars and fuel cells aren't competitive in that application. >i feel like i have to also mention that hydrogen is a terrible energy storage option if you're interested in reducing carbon emissions--dozens of specific physical reasons covered elsewhere. and even apart from carbon, the end to end efficiency is stunningly bad even in the best case. one application that is rarely covered in the media is drone applications-specifically, package delivery via drones to isolated communities. current battery technology can only fly a drone so far round trip. h2 energy storage allows a number times farther delivery for a fuel cell-operated drone. hydrogen fuel cells aren't a perfect solution to all problems. however, several applications make perfect sense and save our customers money.\n",

      "    13. \u001b[1mhappyscrappy\u001b[0m: these trucks are only going to be doing about 200 miles per day it says. thus there should be time to fast charge trucks during the day if there are several convenient, fast (under 1h) and available chargers on the docks. they wouldn't be using lead acid. and i don't think you have to worry about poor performance, these fuel cell vehicles also require batteries (due to poor ability to scale down power output from fuel cells, you end up having to turn then off and running off batteries for a while to be efficient about it) and in this case the batteries are only 12kwh. a 100kwh battery would have much better power output, even after degradation. honestly, i think batteries would work for this (but not long-haul trucking) the issue is that you'd need multiple very high power chargers on site and that would get very expensive.\n",

      "            13. \u001b[1mjunkit33\u001b[0m: that's *still* a fraction of what health care actually costs. a typical family plan for a year costs around <cur>20,000. only paying a <cur>5000 deductible off that is still superior to the <cur>20,000 a year it would cost out of taxes. further to it, most people don't actually hit their deductible in a typical year, so true cost is much less. simplified, yes, but i'm not here to argue the minutiae of exactly what things will cost. the point is taxes *will* increase significantly to pay for it, and middle class families *do not* have that kind of buffer to afford it. nothing is free - you're paying for it one way or another.\n",

      "                17. \u001b[1mTyr_Kovacs\u001b[0m: you've used a specific number as a statement of fact. i'd like to see your evidence for that, or any other number for \"extra\" costs for the \"average middle class family\". of course, if you can't provide it, please feel free to alternatively state \"i made it up because it seems like a number that makes me feel good and i like to lie to win arguments online\". of course, you'll need to produce a detailed agreed upon criteria of what \"middle class\" means. then you'll need to exactly measure how much each individual family pays in their lifetimes in current college tuition fees and health insurance (including all non covered costs and incidentals, plus any loss of earnings they have had due to any illnesses that aren't cost-effective as an individual to treat, and the life long costs of not sending children to college if it's not financially viable.... good luck). then you'll need to know exactly how much state paid tuition and nationalised healthcare costs them individually (maybe look to the more developed countries in the world, most of which already have at least one of those). then subtract the latter from the former. i mean, i wouldn't think you to be so myopic to ignore the sociological benefits to not having to worry about tuition and healthcare, all the extra work hours, all the boosted morale, all the better educated populace. but you said <cur>10,000, so i'm sure you've put a dollar figure on such wide ranging sociological improvements and accounted for it. please show your working out for that too. once you've done that and proved that <cur>10,000 is the average increase per family for those things compared to now, i would also recommend posting it to the world's leading economists and sociologists. they'll be very interested to have decades of research and careful analysis proved pointless by u/junkit33. of course, the fbi will be asking you how you got information that is literally impossible to get without access to detailed generation-long surveillance of the entire nation (or at least at the middle class families)... but you'll be fine. i look forward to reading your thesis or retraction. edit: i got so excited about your imaginary data that i forgot to mentioned, it is about empathy. and as i doubt you have either the data, or the gumption to admit to making stuff up because you have no evidence, i might as well explain to you exactly how much you failed to make a point. \"what even the most middle class moderates (definition with data please) are against (prove it) though is the reality (prove it) of their taxes skyrocketing (prove it) for almost no gain\" (do you mean to them explicitly or in general? one means a lack of empathy, the other is flatly false and can be disproven if a single person in the country, at any point, gets tuition or medical treatment for significantly less cost than before) \"this group is already making well over <cur>15/hr, they're done with college, and they already get cheap subsidized health care through their employer.\" this is exactly the point about empathy. \"i've made my money, i'm ok, everyone else can fuck off and die in a hole instead of me paying anything to help\". they've got theirs, so they won't help anyone else. you say \"it's not about empathy\", so how you define the act of only caring about yourself whilst others that you could help suffer? friendly? supportive? cunty?\n",

      "1. \u001b[1mcappadocianhawk\u001b[0m: most people here, especially the ones who contribute a lot are \"quality men\". i consider myself a quality man also, 2 university degrees, own a business, good looking and fit. real problem is these \"quality women\" usually don't bring anything to the table except their good looks and pussy, and i'm not going to commit for something i can easily get by being a \"quality man\". they are not in scarcity, they are just leeches looking for a man who will give in to their every demand because \"they deserve it\" but they also want the strong independent man. basically alpha bux. she'll break up with you the moment you start going beta though, because \"she deserves better\". paradoxical, yes. but that's women for you.\n",
      "    2. \u001b[1mhalfback910\u001b[0m: i'm sure it's been floated around here, but did you see the article where a wall street stock broker explained to a \"gorgeous\" 25 year old woman (girl, let's call her what she was, a girl) who was literally writing in a column whining about \"only being able to get guys who make 250k, when really i need 500k to live a nice life in the center of nyc!\"? he explained to her, in finance terms, that she was a depreciating asset and he was an appreciating asset. so it made sense for him to rent, not buy.\n",

      "            5. \u001b[1mhalfback910\u001b[0m: the last part of your analysis was one that i hadn't heard before but makes sense on its face. what you said reminded me of something. there was a weird itinerant philosophy preacher who visited my campus multiple times and spoke in public while i was in college. i couldn't nail down exactly what he believed, but he was one of the sort of proto-redpill people that got me started on the path towards the realization that this outlook was correct. one poignant thing he said was \"there is nothing that looks so natural on its face but is so unnatural as female-male sexual relationships. there is nothing that looks so unnatural on its face but is so natural as male-male sexual relationships.\" he bought into the renaissance/humanist idea that true love could only be between two men because, according to him, women were entirely incapable of love. it was just an emotion/feeling that, if you looked at the definition, only men had and only men *could* have. what you said is similar to a lot of things he would claim. he also praised the way that homosexual culture approached relationships (sexual and platonic) in general. i.e. the idea that romantic relationships were ephemeral but friends were forever and how that was actually very much in line with plato's philosophy (i believe it was plato he cited). edit: upon recollection, as i pick more and more at the memories of this guy, he was into a *lot* of proto-versions of ideologies i would later adopt. he was into calvinist prosperity gospel (i.e. if you are rich, it's because you deserve it and earned it and it's a good and holy thing to be rich). which i would describe as a very blunted, cloudy form of anarcho-capitalism, an ideology i'd go on to adopt. weird to think that this person may have inadvertently shaped a lot of my beliefs.\n",
      "                9. \u001b[1mcappadocianhawk\u001b[0m: i also consider myself an anarcho-capitalist, which explains most of my views regarding sexual marketplace. i view any human interaction as a transaction so i consider it a very literal marketplace. that man you talked about seems like a great guy to sit and have a talk with, truly ahead of his time it seems.\n",
