    "# Applying the Expected Context Framework to Wikipedia discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an application of the Expected Context Framework to analyze Wikipedia talk page discussions. We are working up to the following question: what types of comments are more likely to start conversations that eventually derail into toxic personal attacks, versus conversations that remain civil throughout? The notebook goes over a few key function calls along the way; for further details, see [this paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Conversations_gone_awry_files/conversations_gone_awry.pdf) for details on the analysis question and datasets, and [TODO: DISSERTATION] for details on the framework and more comments on the below analyses."

    "For this demo, we start by training an Expected Context Model on a collection of Wikipedia discussions (different from the dataset we later analyze). In short, we want to infer different _rhetorical types_ of comments that occur at the start of these discussions. Via the framework, we'll derive representations of comments based on their expected replies (the \"forwards context\" of the conversation), and then infer types of comments by clustering these representations. We interpret the resultant clusters as different rhetorical types."
