      "            I think this is an important point to keep in mind.  I went to a public school in a very poor neighborhood where most people don't speak English. Sailed right through with straight A's. Then I got to college, got into a rigorous science program, and...still made A's. Most of my peers were from much wealthier schools or were homeschooled or were privately schooled; they also had higher SAT scores than I did, since I didn't get to take any SAT prep classes and was otherwise pretty underprepared. The thing is, I was used to making A's—so anything less than that was absolutely *not* acceptable to me. I worked considerably harder and partied considerably less than the majority of my peers, who were used to B's and C's.  I wish I'd had a better education when I was younger because I'd probably be smarter now for it—but getting used to being at the top of my class from an early age and stubbornly refusing to give that up was certainly a benefit, too. I'm grateful that my university decided to put more stock in my grades than in my SAT scores or schooling background in my particular case. I'm also grateful that having straight A's in high school got me a full scholarship to college, even if those A's weren't as rigorous as they would have been elsewhere. I either wouldn't have been able to go to college, or I'd be deep in debt now. As it stands, I'm totally debt-free and better off than my parents—and if I ever have children, they will have an easier childhood and a better early education than I had.\n",

The suspects were captured at 3 a.m. in Philadelphia. They have not been formally charged, but they have been arrested in connection with Morgan's killing, officials said. Morgan, 32, was the last officer to leave Sunrise Gentleman's Lounge on Straight Street after a birthday party for another Newark cop on Sunday night, authorities said. When Morgan and a dancer from the club walked outside about 3 a.m., they were approached by a man in his 20s who tried to rob them at gunpoint, police have said. Morgan tried to draw his weapon to stop the robbery, Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio said, but he was shot once in the torso while trying to defend himself and the woman &gt; http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/arrests_made_in_fatal_shooting.html   --------------------------  &gt; 11/10/2011 &gt; A man convicted of a fatal shooting at the Yours Convenience Store in Catonsville was sentenced to life behind bars without parole on Thursday.  &gt; Braderick Greene (Green on vinelink), 37, was convicted of murder in the death of Brian Meise and the attempted murder of store owner Sudhir Shah in 2009.  &gt; Prosecutors said Greene walked into the store on Frederick Road in November 2009, immediately shot Meise, who was a customer, then robbed the cash register and shot Shah in the head. Shah was still able to call 911. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45240372/ns/local_news-baltimore_md/t/man-gets-life-prison-store-killing/  ---------------------------  &gt; October 25, 2011 &gt; ATLANTA -- The girlfriend of an Army National Guard soldier who fatally shot a sheriff's deputy and himself told investigators the gunman \"definitely had a drinking problem\" and grabbed an assault rifle from his trunk after she made him pull over while he was driving drunk, a Georgia sheriff said Monday. \"She said he had been drinking and he was drunk and that when he gets drunk, he gets violent,\" Richmond County Sheriff Ronald Strength said. \"Why shoot a law enforcement officer? We don't have that answer.\" Spc.

However, it is very apparent that if you are an attractive man with moderate to high status, you have all the power in picking who to have a relationship.  The last few relationships I've had, I initiated the initial interactions, but after hooking up, the woman switches to pursuing.  They have to keep me interested, and they know it.  Game and MRA might be conflicting ideology, but it's definitely advantageous to be familiar with both.

He certainly isn't going to work hard pursuing her (no matter what entitled feminists think). If you want someone higher status than you, than you must pursue more than they would.

The comment about domestic violence is to me very interesting that you believe that men do not initiate most of the domestic violence in this country. The fact of the matter is yes, it is conceivable that women initiate as many instances of domestic violence when referring to community based research samples, however if you were to look at the statistics for agency and hospital samples of domestic violence you would find that a larger percentage of reported cases of domestic violence involve a male assaulting a female. Men typically do not report such instances of domestic violence because of the socially constructed gender stereotype of being \"Manly\" which is to say in our society not getting beat up by a girl. The fact of the matter is that Tiger Woods situation is quite rare for the most part when a man abuses a female the physical damage is much more substantial most likely due to the fact that by their biological nature men are physically stronger and more aggressive than most women. Your argument should not be about who abuses who more often, it really should be how domestic violence is not acceptable no matter who the assailant may be. \n",
