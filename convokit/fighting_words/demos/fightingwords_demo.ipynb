My generation had a plethora of resources at our disposal: \"I kissed dating goodbye\" \"silver ring thing\" \"true love waits\" \"purity rings\" \"purity pledges\" were all around us. My church opted to use \" Every Young Man's/Woman's Battle\" as their guide to teach us about sexuality as well as some media from Teen Mania ministries. \n",

      "Through these media, I learned that love was like a quantity. The more partners you had sex with, the more your ability to love would be cut in half. Someone who had only one partner could love them fully, but someone who had two partners would have half the ability to love because they'd already given pieces of their heart away to somebody else and formed a permanent soul tie. Their relationships would be forever tainted with emotional baggage and resentment. Only the emotionally pure would have blissful married sex. Unfortunately, even a simple crush or a kiss could taint one's emotional purity, so one had to carefully guard their heart to prevent losing even the tiniest piece of their heart. Metaphors like spit in a cup, pre-chewed gum, flower with it's petals pulled off were used to show us that those who engaged in premarital sex were as worthless as used or damaged goods. I was taught that masturbation was selfish and sinful. While young men struggle with porn, young women struggle with emotional needs when it comes to sex - according to every young woman's battle. From these ideas came concepts like \"no-touch courtship\" and even \"betrothal\" in far more conservative corners of the church as an answer to the seemingly corrupt dating world. Some daughters were taken to purity balls where their fathers promised to be the protectors of their virginity and carefully select for them their future husbands to whom they could entrust their daughter to. Like it or not, these teachings and a great many others are still prevalent. Do you know which ones your church teaches your children? \n",

Some - including myself - experience sexual dysfunction after years of repressing our sexuality, it doesn't just work at the snap of a finger. How can we as the current generation of leaders of the church change the dialogue to create a more sex-positive message that helps the next generation walk in truth and not lies and fear? I truly believe that the church has to recognize it's role in damaging young souls just as they are learning about sexuality and must have a hand in changing the message if the church wants to have a future. I do believe that these flawed teachings are half the reason why my generation isn't having as many kids as early in life as my parents and grandparents did. We've all be guilt-tripped, shamed, and frightened by the mere thought of accepting ourselves as the sexual beings we were made to be. \n",

I was paranoid cops where after me and that people could hear my thoughts. So I thought this man named Chris was a cop so we played a basketball game of pig. Earlier in my life I saw a vision of Blessed Mother Mary on top of our milking barn. While I was playing with him I kept saying in my head.. let me go I saw Mary. I took three outside 3 pointers and every time time I shot I thought the thought. If I make this shot I saw a vision of Mary. After I missed all three shots he turned to me and asked.. do you know Mother Teresa? At this point I was like okay.. that was weird. We proceeded to play the game and later he wanted me to listen to these three cds. This is what the tree were named. The book of Enoch, Something like ‘Christmas music’, and misty Edwards. While we were playing basketball he had on a black vest. He went into his room and came back out a purple zipper pull tab. While I slept I listened the the Enoch, Christmas music instrumentals, and the first song of the misty Edwards cd. I then gave the cd and CD player back to him. I then went into his room and he wanted me to read this single page from revelation. I then read one line from the middle of the paper which read he who holds the world and handed it back to him. I then left the room and went on with my day. I later went outside to smoke a cigarette and I sat next to him and without me paying any attention he elbowed my elbow. I then later went to an AA meeting with this girl named summer whiting. I also thought she was a cop so I would talk to her and be nice to her. I noticed she was carrying a purple gateraide. She sat by me and at the end of the meeting we were about to hold  hands and say the Lord’s Prayer and summer put her head down and said I’m sorry. She then held my hand until the prayer was over and while we were saying the prayer I felt something deep within. Like something was eating at my insides. I then later saw Chris and summer sitting outside together where it looked like Chris was avoiding her and she was smiling and talked to him. My time was up at ASC and I got moved to the Arbor halfway house. She followed me to Arbor and wrote me a letter thanking me for being there for her and what not. I She asked me if I would sit with her while she smoked a cigarette. I said yes as I quit smoking and chewing a couple weeks earlier. All this happened in Oct, Nov, and Dec of 2017. She was then listening to a song by Griz where she was singing along and said I’m the reaper. After I heard this I completely avoided her and wouldn’t talk to her until one night she got a dui and was crying and asked if I would talk to her. Before this she played that one YouTube video of will ferrel video of the song don’t fear the reaper while will Ferrell says I need more cowbell. While at ACS we used to eat these sour mike and ikes. Then at Arbor she gave me another box. About 6 months before this I was walking to my parents house on the highway and I was walking in the line in the middle kinda hoping to get hit. By the grace of of God I almost got hit a semi and the semi almost hit the ditch. Jesus had more planned for me. I was then mopping the floor and I saw summer walk the vinyl line. I later was in the kitchen and I set my cup down on the table and I noticed that the way my cup looked by all the other ones I looked like a Stella consolation. Later on in the day I went to the kitchen and I saw summer by the island with cups and a blue power aide as the Stella star. And as soon as I saw it she walked away. I was then sitting in the living watching tv when summer came out of her room and I thought I heard something almost like I heard her thought. She asked me if she could use my calling card because the phone wouldn’t go long distance. I went and grabbed my card and went I handed it to her she touched me and I never heard it again. She then tried going around halfway house giving stuff to people to try and touch them is what I think. Flashback to before she got this dui. I was sitting in the living room on the chair watching tv again and she asked people if they wanted to go to the Strawberry a bar in town. She asked two people and either I never heard them say anything or they never said anything and just follows her. She then sat on the arm rest of the chair and put her arm around me and said let’s go to the Strawberry. I said no and would barely talk to her. She said I want to kiss you. If I remember right still didn’t say anything. Maybe said no about a couple times. She then gave up and the three left. The guy that was sitting in the chair next to me when over to the calendar hanging on the wall and started lightly banging his head on it in front of me. Now this is where it gets crazy. About a week or two before this I was laying in bed. And I thought do you want to lick me amd then I vfelt someting like touch my neck and I heard in her voice like a licking noise and a haha. I then had the thought.. what if I kill you? I then heard a voice in that sounded like hers say.. pewwwww boom. I then went to bed. It was either that night or a a few nights later I was sound asleep and I woke up to what felt like someone or something was holding my head to the side to where I couldn’t move and I felt something bite my neck. I then became angry and several moments later I kept thinking I’m gonna kill you. I then did not sleep with my lamp or room light off until my Roomate came/ she left. While I was writing this in the tractor tonight I had one AirPod in and as soon as I wrote the name Chris I heard like a whip noise and then the first time I wrote summer whiting I also heard a whipping noise.

      "John 1:1, 2:  RS reads: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.” (KJ, Dy, JB, NAB use similar wording.) However, NW reads: “In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god. This one was in the beginning with God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Which translation of John 1:1, 2 agrees with the context? John 1:18 says: “No one has ever seen God.” Verse 14 clearly says that “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us . . . we have beheld his glory.” Also, verses 1, 2 say that in the beginning he was “with God.” Can one be with someone and at the same time be that person? At John 17:3, Jesus addresses the Father as “the only true God”; so, Jesus as “a god” merely reflects his Father’s divine qualities.—Heb. 1:3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the rendering “a god” consistent with the rules of Greek grammar? Some reference books argue strongly that the Greek text must be translated, “The Word was God.” But not all agree. In his article “Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,” Philip B. Harner said that such clauses as the one in John 1:1, “with an anarthrous predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in meaning. They indicate that the logos has the nature of theos.” He suggests: “Perhaps the clause could be translated, ‘the Word had the same nature as God.’” (Journal of Biblical Literature, 1973, pp. 85, 87) Thus, in this text, the fact that the word the·os′ in its second occurrence is without the definite article (ho) and is placed before the verb in the sentence in Greek is significant. Interestingly, translators that insist on rendering John 1:1, “The Word was God,” do not hesitate to use the indefinite article (a, an) in their rendering of other passages where a singular anarthrous predicate noun occurs before the verb. Thus at John 6:70, JB and KJ both refer to Judas Iscariot as “a devil,” and at John 9:17 they describe Jesus as “a prophet.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In harmony with the above, AT reads: “the Word was divine”; Mo, “the Logos was divine”; NTIV, “the word was a god.” In his German translation Ludwig Thimme expresses it in this way: “God of a sort the Word was.” Referring to the Word (who became Jesus Christ) as “a god” is consistent with the use of that term in the rest of the Scriptures. For example, at Psalm 82:1-6 human judges in Israel were referred to as “gods” (Hebrew, ’elo·him′; Greek, the·oi′, at John 10:34) because they were representatives of Jehovah and were to speak his law\n",

The other reference, in one of the letters to Timothy, isn’t talking about sin, but about not living in the same way as the world does. In Romans, the third reference, it also doesn’t condemn it.

      "Evidence for Arab Migration\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several problems associated with estimating Arab immigration into Palestine during the 1920s, the principal one being that Arab migration flows were, in the main, illegal, and therefore unreported and unrecorded.[17] But they were not entirely unnoticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demographer U.O. Schmelz's analysis of the Ottoman registration data for 1905 populations of Jerusalem and Hebron kazas (Ottoman districts), by place of birth, showed that of those Arab Palestinians born outside their localities of residence, approximately half represented intra-Palestine movement—from areas of low-level economic activity to areas of higher-level activity—while the other half represented Arab immigration into Palestine itself, 43 percent originating in Asia, 39 percent in Africa, and 20 percent in Turkey.[18] Schmelz conjectured:\n",
      "\n",
      "The above-average population growth of the Arab villages around the city of Jerusalem, with its Jewish majority, continued until the end of the mandatory period. This must have been due—as elsewhere in Palestine under similar conditions—to in-migrants attracted by economic opportunities, and to the beneficial effects of improved health services in reducing mortality—just as happened in other parts of Palestine around cities with a large Jewish population sector.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      " in growth rates between Palestine and the other less developed countries (LDCs), the idea that at least one-third of Palestine's population growth may be attributed to immigration is—using Bachi's own growth rate differentials—not an entirely unreasonable one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lacking verifiable evidence did not prevent Bachi from stating the obvious concerning internal migration within Palestine:\n",
      "\n",
      "The great economic development of the coastal plains—largely due to Jewish immigration—was accompanied both in 1922-1931 and in 1931-1944 by a much stronger increase of the Muslim and Christian populations in this region than that registered in other regions. This was probably due to two reasons: stronger decrease in mortality of the non-Jewish population in the neighborhood of Jewish areas and internal migration toward the more developed zones.[22]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the footnote accompanying this quote, Bachi writes: \"As no statistics are available for internal migration, this conclusion has been obtained from indirect evidence.\"[23] Bachi's footnote is instructive. The \"indirect evidence\" he referred to no doubt included his understanding of the important role economics plays in explaining demographic movements. While appreciating the value of Ottoman registrations and British mandatory government censuses in providing estimates of Palestinian demography, they were, in his judgment, still crude and incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reference to Arab immigration into Palestine during the 1920s is made as well in the British mandatory government's annual compilation of statistical data on population. The Palestine Blue Book, 1937, for example, provides time series demographic statistics whose annual estimates are based on extrapolations from its 1922 census.[24] The footnote accompanying the table on population of Palestine reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been unrecorded illegal immigration of both Jews and Arabs in the period since the census of 1931, but it is clear that, since it cannot be recorded, no estimate of its volume is possible.[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1935 British report to the League of Nations noted that:\n",
      "\n",
      "One thousand five hundred and fifty-seven persons (including 565 Jews) who, having made their way into the country surreptitiously, were later detected, were sentenced to imprisonment for their offence and recommended for deportation.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "The number who \"made their way into the country surreptitiously\" and undetected was neither estimated nor mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historian Gad Gilbar's observation on Ruth Kark's contribution to his edited volume Ottoman Palestine, 1800-1914, touches on the issue of Arab immigration into and within Palestine. He relates her ideas in \"The Rise and Decline of Coastal Towns in Palestine\" to Charles Issawi's thesis concerning the role of minority groups and foreigners in the development of Middle Eastern towns. Explaining why no other Palestinian cities grew as rapidly as Jaffa and Haifa did during the final three decades of the Ottoman rule, Gilbar writes: \"Both attracted population from the rural and urban surroundings and immigrants from outside Palestine.\"[27]\n",
      "\n",
      "Each piece of the demographic puzzle by itself may reveal no identifiable picture. But given a multiplicity of such pieces, an image does begin to appear. The Royal Institute for International Affairs adds another piece. Commenting on the growth of the Palestinian population during the decades of the 1920s and 1930s it reports: \"The number of Arabs who have entered Palestine illegally from Syria and Transjordan is unknown. But probably considerable.\"[28] And C.S. Jarvis, governor of the Sinai from 1923-36, adds yet another:\n",
      "\n",
      "This illegal immigration was not only going on from the Sinai, but also from Trans-Jordan and Syria, and it is very difficult to make a case out for the misery of the Arabs if at the same time their compatriots from adjoining states could not be kept from going in to share that misery.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimating Real Numbers\n",
      "\n",
      "The derivation of Palestine migration estimates in this section is based on an uncomplicated imputation theory. Migration becomes a residual claimant for numbers not explained by a population-estimating model based on known initial population stocks and known sets of birth and death rates for that population. In this way, expected population stocks can be derived for any set of subsequent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of the model depends, of course, on the reliability of the estimates given for initial population stocks and for the rates associated with natural increase. Therein lies the problem with estimating Arab immigration into Palestine. The model itself may be simple and applicable, but its usefulness—as with all estimating models—is contingent upon the quality of the data inputs. That quality in the case of Palestinian migration is compromised by the explicit neglect of illegal entrants. If illegal migrants and subsequently illegal residents escaped the census taker, how could the census account for them? It couldn't and didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not surprising then that the British census data produce an Arab Palestinian population growth for 1922-31 that turns out to be generated by natural increase and legal migrations alone. Applying a 2.5 per annum growth rate[30]to a population stock of 589,177 for 1922 generates a 1931 population estimate of 735,799 or 97.6 percent of the 753,822 recorded in the 1931 census. Does the imputation model then \"prove\" that illegal immigration into Palestine was inconsequential during 1922-31? Not at all. A footnote accompanying the census's population time series acknowledges the presence in Palestine of illegal Arab immigration. But because it could not be recorded, no estimate of its numbers was included in the census count.[31] Ignoring illegal migrants does not mean they don't exist.\n",
      " 1948 Israel, identified not only the direction of Arab Palestinian migration within Palestine but its magnitude as well.[32]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arab Palestinian populations within those sub-districts that eventually became Israel increased from 321,866 in 1922 to 463,288 in 1931 or by 141,422. Applying the 2.5 per annum natural rate of population growth to the 1922 Arab Palestinian population generates an expected population size for 1931 of 398,498 or 64,790 less than the actual population recorded in the British census. By imputation, this unaccounted population increase must have been either illegal immigration not accounted for in the British census and/or registered Arab Palestinians moving from outside the Jewish-identified sub-districts to those sub-districts so identified. This 1922-31 Arab migration into the Jewish sub-districts represented 11.8 percent of the total 1931 Arab population residing in those sub-districts and as much as 36.8 percent of its 1922-31 growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "That over 10 percent of the 1931 Arab Palestinian population in those sub-districts that eventually became Israel had immigrated to those sub-districts within the 1922-31 years is a datum of considerable significance. It is consistent with the fragmentary evidence of illegal migration to and within Palestine; it supports the idea of linkage between economic disparities and migratory impulses—a linkage universally accepted; it undercuts the thesis of \"spatial stickiness\" attributed by some scholars to the Arab Palestinian population of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; and it provides strong circumstantial evidence that the illegal Arab immigration into Palestine, like that within Palestine, was of consequence as well.\n",

      "Answer number one: This world has such awful things in it because we have free will. Human beings are flawed, angry, prideful and greedy. Even the best of us. If everyone were to follow Christ's teaching to love everyone, care for the poor and the sick and to give freely of ourselves, then War, famine, and AIDS babies in Africa would not be problems. Not because God is punishing us, but because we are punishing ourselves with our behavior. War is man made. Famine is man made - there is enough wasted food to feed the entire staving population of the earth four times over. The spread of AIDS in Africa could have been curtailed long ago with proper education and health care. If we were all one people, who loved and listened to each other and watched out for the least, many of the worst of these things would not be a problem. But we're not. There is no one who is perfectly good - certainly not a bunch of Christians we could both point out. Hell, I am sitting here writing this on a computer that was probably built by some over-worked, under-paid, (possibly child) laborer in China. But hey, I \"need\" a computer, so I contribute to a global economic system that exploited someone I'll never know. A system that will continue to create wars and leave people sick and starving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, okay but even if I accept that free will is the cause for most misery globally, why does God allow these bad things to happen to Christians? Isn't God supposed to be acting directly in his followers lives? Yes, he is. But, as the world is full of pain and suffering, we need to be a part of the world in order to understand it, reach out and empathize with it. To have compassion. When someone is going through something, the support of a person who has gone through that thing and can say \"Here I am. I got through it. So can you.\" can be very helpful \n",

      "I was homeless for almost two years about 12 years ago. Now I make very good money, live in a great neighborhood and have a beautiful wife and kid. That was the transformative power of God in my life. But going through that period of having nothing was so important to who I am now. There is a pretty terrible homeless problem in Los Angeles and it spills over into my otherwise fairly upscale neighborhood. Every time I start to think negatively about those people, it helps me to remember where I was not all that long ago. And whenever I'm able to give them some money, it always comes with an acknowledgement that I was once in their shoes. Our church has a food pantry I get to direct them to as well - an interfaith food pantry, so no it's not an \"accept Christ and we'll give you some rations\" deal, in case you were wondering. Also part of our church outreach, my wife and son help feed the homeless lunch at the park every second Sunday of the month.\n",

      "When I was 13 my mom had stage 4 breast cancer. I am an only child of a single mom. If she had died, that was my whole family. Thanks to the doctors at Virginia Mason in Seattle, she survived. She was on an experimental chemo and she was the only person to survive it. Science saved her life. But God got us through that time. It was our church who surrounded us and took care of us in that time. Our church who allowed her the peace of mind to fight it and our church who looked after me and gave me peace in that time. Our church was the arm of God in that time of life which was unfathomably dark. To this day, she attributes much of her survival to that love from that community. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why did God have to give your mom cancer in the first place? Couldn't he have just told you how to love with his awesome God powers?\" Well, firstly, I don't believe God *makes* anyone sick. As stated above, I believe we are children with free will and that has lead the earth to a state where things like war and disease run rampant. But if he is all powerful, why would he allow that? Doesn't merely allowing it make him evil? Well, would you rather live in a totalitarian state where every aspect of your life is controlled but you are safe, or would you rather live in a free country where life is full of risk? It's the same choice. People desire to be free. We chose this world. And while God allows people to become sick, if one is plugged in to God and his people, flawed as they are, a great deal of good can come from that. When I was 13, I was literally changing puke buckets for my bald and likely-dying mom. And it was okay, we both found strength and got through it because we were surrounded by love and support. And for the rest of my life, knowing what that kind of supportive, communal love looks like, I can give that to other people. I can tell others who are going through the same thing \"I know what you are going through\" and they can feel less alone.\n",

My wife and kid are waking up upstairs right now and as I hear them, I am so grateful. I can look back on that time I was sleeping on a park bench across from the guy who smelled like pee and know that for however long this moment lasts, it is that much more precious.

Rather than exploiting raped kids as an opportunity to demonize and scapegoat all gay people as pedophiles and avoid accountability for the institutional problems that cause pervasive coverups of sexual abuse, we would like the church to actually undertake meaningful reforms to protect them.  What the church needs is for laity like you to start caring more about raped kids than you do about hating queer people, because as long as you refuse to, you will continue to be appeased by seeing the people you hate framed, and the church will continue to get away with raping kids and covering it up.  Even the John Jay report agreed that homosexuality was not the issue, and as much as people with an agenda like to manipulate statistics, an adult man who prefers to rape little girls who are fourteen years or younger is not called \"straight;\" 80% of the victims were 14 or younger, the men who raped them can't be called \"gay\" either.  Pedophilia is entirely distinct from an adult sexual orientation, and abuse is often more about power and opportunity than sexual desire anyway. If you want to stop the rape of children, a clerical culture of pervasive secrecy, shame, and extortion needs to be reformed.  Demonizing gay people is only exacerbating *all* of those problems. \n",

Most people calling other's fascist have no idea what fascism is, and by excercising their arbitrary \"elitism\" they are in fact the fascists themselves.  Perhaps another defintion is making business and government heavily integrated.  Some would call that partial socialism for the rich instead of the fascism Mussolini defined.  For that to work, society needs an agreed upon dictionary, which does not work in America. Much of America's civil strife is occuring between two factions.  One faction thinks the language is relatively static and the other thinks words mean different things and each person can create differing interpretations of fact. In this notion of so many \"interpretations\" the entire concept of a solid understanding of meaning via precise words is missing.   I don't support liberal democracy, precisely for reason like the one mentioned, where people can attempt to define words and sentences to mean whatever they want them to mean.

He had to get married (not in the mormon temple because they weren’t “worthy”, which is humiliating as a mormon), and had to wait a year to get re-baptized into the church. I honestly think this traumatized something in him and he never fully recovered. Learning from others about how he was growing up, how his career has gone, and how he was as a father raising us just seems different from how he could have been if he was never “X’d”.\n",

You aren’t allowed to speak your opinion of something during lessons, and you aren’t allowed to take part in the weekly sacrament, which is somewhat sacred for mormons. You also obviously can’t do anything temple related, which is also very sacred for mormons. Excommunication in the mormon Church means you are straight up, no longer a member, and need to be rebaptized into the church after a year. Disfellowshipment isn’t really made public, but excommunication is made public among the congregation. And boy...do mormons talk. It’s just a game of telephone after that.

      "Evolution a law that states over time and multiple generations the allele frequency changes. Life changes. The genes change, get removed, or added over time so that the phenotypes resulting from the genes changes. There are many natural processes to show how that works which have been proven. They are facts that are used to establish *how* the observations of life evolving take place. The theory is the explanation of reality combining the facts and the laws of life undergoing change. If something doesn't reproduce it doesn't pass on genes and the genes that get passed on are effected by the genes available, mutations, and heredity. Sometimes a virus adds genes along the way. The other facts help to establish a family tree that looks more like a tumble weed but essentially all life is related such that evolution explains the history of life as well as the mechanisms for life to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of evolutionary theory remains true even if we find a better theory which we have a few times when it comes to evolution. If you start with the observations of life changing you can assume as Owen did that a god learns from his mistakes giving you old earth creation, if you assume it is based on a parent child relationship you get evolution. Lamark and Darwin had competing ideas where in one the changes were random and small acted on by natural and sexual selection and in the other the changes were related to whatever the parents did in adult form. If the parent stretches a bit then the child comes out a but stretched out or perhaps there are a bunch of minor differences for neck and leg length and the ones that just happened to have longer legs and necks were a better fit for nature. Those best fit for nature might have been deemed sexy by the population at large and also more likely to not starve to death or get eaten. This is Darwinian evolution. Life undergoes tiny changes from generation to generation which seem random and nature kills off the ones least fit. The survival of the fittest means that long neck giraffes outcompeted the short necked giraffes for food and thus survived to reproductive age more often and passed on their traits. Darwin was right about this but wrong in other areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then came along heredity to explain why you don't get birds giving birth to frogs or crocodiles giving rise directly to humans. All forms of life are some combination of features inherited from someone in their family tree following  the parent - child relationships. Sometimes you carry a trait that you don't express but that carried trait came from your own lineage. Eye color, hair color, height, skin color, and other traits are directly linked to your parents but your siblings will get some other mix. Darwinism and heredity merged to form a better theory for evolution. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then they discovered how DNA works and can be used to trace a family history and how it can be used to explain phenotypical traits. They learned that humans have somewhere around 128 mutations just in the gamete to zygote stages of development and undergo just as many mutations at least 30 more times in their lifetime. This was used to show that mutation isn't truly random and that most mutations go unnoticed. Most of the mutations you experience that would be detrimental lead to things like cell death or cancer unless they happen to get passed onto the next generation where they are more likely to take hold in things such as muscular dystrophy, down syndrome, fibra mialgia, sickle cell anemia or other cases that don't end in immediate death. Some beneficial mutations are things like the ability to consume milk into adulthood, skin color to match the environment before permanent housing was a thing, the immunity to HIV, the low body fat and developed muscles, strong bones, or the ability to survive high altitudes without getting altitude sickness. Most of the other mutations are neutral like eye color or whatever. It was discovered that viruses led to evolution and that neotony played a huge role as well many times. The vertebrates descended from an ancestor something like a universe but which lives out its life in bilateral mobile form which is the juvenile stage. Humans retain the juvenile ape skull so that instead of the crest on top of our heads and the powerful jaw muscles we have weak jaws and large brains.\n",

I do not have the right to use the body of any other person against their will in order to survive just as no other person has the right to use my body against my will in order to survive. So the fetus has rights, and the right to life ends when it requires the use of another person's body against their will in order to survive. Same way it ends for you and me. As for the post 26 wk question, I don't think you understand my definition of abortion. This also negates your viability inclusion if you're trying to go off of that. As I said, I define abortion as the termination of the pregnancy. So let's take it to the extreme and do one at 39 wks. Do you know what they call the surgical termination of a pregnancy at 39 wks? A C-section.\n",

It's pretty hard to manage an unsuccessful surgical abortion. And abstinence will ensure not becoming pregnant (well, depending on your religion), but we try to evaluate real world situations. Teenagers are going to have sex. We've tried the abstinence only programs, total failure. There are also married couples who simply don't want kids. Do you expect them to abstain from sex the entire course of their marriage or until one of them becomes sterile? Be realistic here.

The friend thought this was pretty strange, and made a comment about how she was glad Catholics didn't do anything like that. My wife was quick enough to say, \"don't you guys think the cracker and wine transubstantiate during communion?\" This made her friend think for a long long time (months worth of reflection).

I simply was arguing that it provided something and that something was a promise. I don't think those prosperity pastors will keep their promises and I don't think for one second they carry the true word of Christ. Even if I don't like, I have to acknowledge that they do provide a promise for people who believe that promise, and sometimes it might be all that keeps them going and sometimes it gives them a purpose. I'm not so knowledgeable, so worldly, or wise, that I would take someone's most important thing from them (that promise of salvation), and I'm not so arrogant as to tell them about their experiences of their reality. Whether or not I agree with it, I'll listen and hope they get what's important to them, that thing that keeps them striving when maybe nothing else will.

      "As to me, I don't follow a theology. I was raised Catholic, and I ended that as soon as possible, for every reason that every other recovering Catholic chose to leave. I could never reconcile a prophet of love (The Big J) condemning anyone to eternal suffering, especially for trivial things like: religious faith, gender identity, political affiliation, and such. The hypocrisy was obvious and I wouldn't be a part of it. If I have any trace amount of piety, or religiousness then it's most likely due to old lessons from old times in memories long dormant. I have thought often of Christianity and at its core, at least as I see (even if no one else does), it's kinda fucking beautiful: love your neighbor as yourself. That's it. The Old Testament shouldn't even be permitted in Christianity since it was all before Christ. That shit is full of nastiness, hate, and fear mongering. The Old Testament is some straight up bullshit. And, the new testament could have almost been written as: love your neighbor as yourself. But again, this is my interpretation - and I'm stupid when it comes to the complexities of theological studies (because really, what's the point?). I will admit to trying to live as Jesus did... to a degree. I obviously am not the son of God, so I've gotta pay taxes, support my son, and I've got to have a job for this. Without doubt, I can't throw it all away right now and walk the world just asking people to be good to their neighbors. So... I fail everyday at loving my neighbors but I try... and some neighbors I'll try loving again tomorrow but not today - because they passed me off. I am petty, and selfish, and human, and have limits - but I don't hold it against myself. I just keep trying, because I'd rather fail at helping the world be a better place then not.\n",

      "I don't ask God for much, maybe 15 times in my life. Mostly, if there's a God I assume he/she had much better things to do than worry about me. So I let God be God and I let me be me and perhaps the two shall never meet - and that's alright. Why wait for God to make my life better right? Lastly, I once heard that God was everywhere. If so, that meant I never had to go to church again and listen to ignorantly learned fools discuss the intricacies of Mark and yet miss the whole fucking point of the whole fucking thing: love your neighbors as yourself. \n",

God in the person of Jesus, takes on the consequences and punishment for sin for us - all you had to do is repent and believe.

If you've got ten minutes to spare, check out [Apostate Prophet's video](https://youtu.be/rWGXSIbkFcg) on the expression 'Allahu Akbar'; he discusses the etymology of the words, and why 'Allah' is, in Islam, a proper name for the Islamic deity, and isn't simply the Arabic word for 'god'.\n",

It's an attempt to hijack the moral high ground, and then use it as a tool of social control.  Look at all the rules in religion that have nothing to do with being nice to people.  Many are tribalistic rules about identifying with the group (circumcision to 'mark' the person as a group member, telling them what and how to worship, rules of dress and behavior, even when it doesn't affect others, and so on), while many are rules about how to treat outsiders.

Also, the wording of the second amendment is open to interpretation - \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, **the right of the people to keep and bear arms**, shall not be infringed.”  Militias, particularly around this time frame, were just civilians with weapons - in some cases, loosely organized by a representative within their own body, but certainly not by a representative of the government (federal, state, or local).  It is also reasonable to assume, considering the events that led up to the constitution and the creation of America, that this right to bear arms extends a measure of defense for the civilian population against a tyrannical government (the implication being our own government, should it come to it).  \n",

Some people find it a problem but that’s just the choice you make when you come to Switzerland.
