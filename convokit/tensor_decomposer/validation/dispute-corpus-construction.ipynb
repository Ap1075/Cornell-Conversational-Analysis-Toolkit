Agreed, one American source is not strong enough evidence to support the case that war crimes took place. But there is no harm in us referring to the \"allegation\" of the war crime. Firstly, I have to say the timing looks very interesting. The alleged crime took place at the same time as the Warsaw Uprising, where Axis troops massacred about 200,000 Polish civilians and did the most awful things to Poles, like gang raping terminally ill Polish female cancer patients in their hospital beds. In revenge, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Polish troops in France did execute about 1000 of their German prisoners, nor would I be surprised if Allied High Command turned a blind eye. Secondly, we should be aware that Allied conduct in France is being re-examined right now, e.g. the Allied bombing of French civilians in Caen, and the allegations of rape of French civilians by the U.S. Army, and that black American soldiers tended to be punished for rape but white American soldiers tended not to be. These subjects have been taboo for a long time, and should not be taboo in an encyclopaedia. Perhaps the solution is for us to refer to the crimes as allegations rather than facts.

For the record, I think Polish reprisal executions of Waffen-SS POWs at Falaise were entirely possible, especially considering the revenge motive. Germans bombarded the Polish Red Cross compound on Hill 262, even after the Poles had allowed a ceasefire for the Germans to evacuate German Red Cross vans out of the Falaise Pocket. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Aleksander Stefanowicz\\'s speech, the the Poles ended the battle with just 110 men, having started with 1500-2000 and having held off 14 German divisions. These included SS troops, who tended not to take untermensch prisoners, as the Stefanowicz speech shows the Poles knew. We should find the data on how many Poles were taken POW by the SS at Hill 262, instead of being shot by the SS when captured, to further assess the revenge motive in the alleged Polish executions. Add the timing of the horrific German behaviour at the Wola massacre and the Warsaw Uprising, and there is definitely a third motive for the killings. Now we need more evidence of Poles saying how proud they are to have executed SS POWs, and ideally some forensic evidence of execution, to prove this. But even then, it is not for us to assert this is a war crime - it is for a court. Until then, all we have are historians\\' \"allegations\". Every other editor on this page, including me, now agrees that the paragraph should stay off the article while being considered, and I suggest you accept the consensus.

As noted by Piotrus above, \"Exceptional claims require exceptional sources\", and to the best of my understanding no such \"exceptional\" evidence was offered. At the end of this process we are left with assertions, slander, and libelous accusations. This troubles me greatly! As to the \"Black Devils March\" by Evan McGilvray, it is one of the most exhaustive, well documented, and highly regarded books on this very subject. Please note that for the most part, this book is based on both Polish and German accounts. The passage on page 51 is particularly telling. It reads: [...] Eventually, the German offensive was broken and the Poles were able to take a large number of prisoners. To the west of 8BS\\'s position, further prisoners were taken and when they were counted, it was discovered that there was a total of 800. Later these prisoners were to suffer causalties from German mortar fire as the Poles were unable to remove them in time to a place of safety\". Another passage pertaining specifically to the prisoners reads: \" In an exchange of anti-tank fire, the German tanks were destroyed and their crews killed. The prisoners panicked and fled into the woods bud did not escape. A further German tank was destroyed by a Sherman tank from the range of several meters. At the moment of the anti-tank shell hitting the tank and exploding, the tank ran onto the legs of a Polish soldier, trapping him. He died on the spot form the fire in the tank and the resulting explosion of the German tank\". Best, Robert ', '_line_number': 40}\n",

He's completely ignoring the point that if the BBC and others to say that there was a majority of civilian casualties, they can be considered correct because they are reliable sources. He is relying on original research to try to claim that all of those articles used Lebanese government figures and that all of them mistakenly used the word civilian (or deliberately) when the Lebanese government didn't.

That the independent AP count, UN count, and HRC counts also claim a majority of civilian deaths, that he has provided no reliable sources that state the majority of the deaths were Hezbollah fighters, and that only one article says that Lebanon doesn't specify civilian casualties just further supports this position.

Between versions, there are edits, omissions, additions, etc., so that the basic underlying flow is there, but in our own WP lingo, the best way to state it, is that there were several POV forks on the original work. According to the court, the work put forth by Schucman and Thetford, was distributed at several stages to many people without a copyright. One of the earliest of these went to the Edgar Cayce group, and is called the HLC version. AFTER that version had been given, Ken Wapnick entered the picture and made many editorial contributions. Wapnick joined forces with Skutch, and his wife Skutch Whitson who had a corporation called the Foundation for Parasensory Investigations (FPI). They later changed the name of that group to Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP), and became board members with Wapnick in the organization he founded with them called FACIM around 1983. During the years betwen 1975 and 1983 the work was distributed to many other parties without a copyright mainly by Skutch Whitson (according to the court records). The amount of POV added before those parties themselves published is debatable, but nevertheless, this is a book that discusses changing one's mind. Therefore, in my opinion, any subtle edits, even on a subliminal basis, could have drastic different outcomes in the readership of the versions. The easy way to put it is that there are several books with several authors all under the same title that carried the legacy original work by Schucman and Thetford. Even after the court case between Penguin/FIP/FACIM and NCCFE/EA, FIP having it's copyright determined void by Federal court, modified their version again, adding a preface, numbering system, and appending another section to the end. Penguin's contract was for $2.5 million to lease the copyright for a period of five years ending in December of 2000. This contract was made between Penguin and FIP. Another earlier printing of the book was funded with $440,000 by a philanthropist, and this funding was also given to FIP. \", '_line_number': 20}\n",

Because of the continuing issues with these sources, back in early January the article was revamped, with the idea of starting from the ground up and writing an encyclopedia entry, as opposed to listing and quoting various primary sources. So what progress has been made towards that end? Almost no progress. We now have another bloated section that extensively lists and quotes journal articles. The prose is very poor, the overall article flow does not exist, there is no sense of organization (not even chronological), etc. The idea of wikipedia is not to open up pubmed, and then write a summary of a study and add some quotes. That simply does not make an encyclopedia article. We need to use more prose, less quotes, we need more contexualization, we need a much better structuring. Perhaps the studies section could be used as sourcing to write such a section, but as it stands, it has no place in a wikipedia entry (if we are going by our MoS and what makes FAs). Seriously, who honestly thinks we have gone in the right direction since January 10th? What can we do to make this article on the path to being good? It seems like there has been too much infighting over what sources to mention and what to exclude that no one has given any thought to actual article structure and flow. -', '_line_number': 0}\n",

So far, though, nobody has ever offered any evidence of any sort that an unborn human is actually more than just a fetus. Do you or anyone take issue with the scientific fact that the human body is just an animal body? Have you noticed that if you Google for the exact phrase \"human animal\" you will get more than 1.5 million matches? There is no aspect of the human animal body that is intrinsically superior to aspects of other animal bodies. Sure, our hands are specialized for grasping in a different way than other apes\\' hands are specialized for grasping, but it can be argued that if humans only grasped the types of things that other apes grasp, for the same purposes that other apes grasp those things, then at least some of the other apes probably have an advantage, because their hands are specialized toward grasping those things, see? If our hands were intrinsically superior, they would be superior at grasping anything for any purpose, and they aren\\'t. Indeed, for some purposes an elephant\\'s trunk is a superior grasping organ than the human hand. But back to the unborn human, and the one thing that sets humans apart from all the creatures that are considered to be only animals: brainpower. Humans generally have a magnitude of unspecialized-but-versatile brainpower that no other animal is known to be able to match. The human mind does appear to be intrinsically superior to the animal mind. However! Note that word \"generally\" in the previous sentence; not every human has that much brainpower. A brain-dead adult human on life-support certainly doesn\\'t, and that\\'s why the Courts allow such a human to be unplugged from that life-support. And, of course, a human fetus measurably also doesn\\'t have that much brainpower. While it is well known that toward the end of a pregnancy the brain of an unborn human is growing at a furious rate, it is still a fact that even the most late-term human fetus ever born didn\\'t have more than merely animal-level total brainpower.

Another (as I mentioned above), are non-scientific terms derived from Latin - prenatal, female, human, male, adult, etc. These classification systems ensure linguistic etymological consistency (ie consistent 'true meaning' of 'language'). Basically, the further removed from the scientific standard, the more colloquial and thus the more connotations and less neutrality, e.g. fetus -> prenatal human -> baby.

The logic implying that the nature and reliablity of self-published Adidam sources is comparable to that of more recognized and (for their time) publically accessible spiritual figures is based on a falacious assumption that the situations are comparable, when there are many unique factors regarding the policies and practices of Adidam and its isolated leader that make the accuracy unusually suspect.

In Lowe\\'s case, for example, failure of a number of less important members actually working outside to accept that a fairly normal \"halo\" seen around the sun associated with a summer storm during a period of indulgences by more important members was a spectacular \"miracle\" resulted in their being excluded from the group. And, despite public claims that the inner circle sexual experimentations (such as the one later described in a published book by Georg Fuerstein on his disillusionment with Adi Da, where a devotee\\'s wife was intoxicated and pressured into less than pleasant sex with the guru in the 1980s) ceased in 1976 after a period of extended partying and indulgences and the expulsion of long time senior member Salvatore Lucania on charges he said later in an interview were fabricated, Adidam later publically admitted in 1985 that such sexual experimentation had continued until \"recently\", (that is around the same time a number disillusioned members with knowledge of the events began to make waves), and that this was hidden from much of the membership because they were not quote, \"advanced enough spiritually\", unquote. And, various Adidam devotees have admitted that over 90% of those with some formal involvement at one time or another are no longer formally involved, that a number of members left as a result of the disclosures, and that most of the current formal membership (much of the growth being outside of the US) was not present during the critical periods in question and has no independent knowledge of both sides of the controversy. Not to mention that a comparison of the earliest materials from the group in the early 1970s with the latest materials, where the leader now claims an exclusive spiritual status unprecedented in cosmic history, shows significant patterns of contradiction and revisionism. In summary the Adidam sources and material are suspect, because of a combination of the extreme, unprecendented cosmic status claims of the leader and his group; the necessity to accept uncritically examined dogma, contradictions and revisionism on faith for even limited access to the leader, precluding independent fact checking; the promulgation, acceptance and demonstrated application of the idea that critical and significant information can be hidden from all those not \"advanced enough spiritually\" (including independent sources), which also precludes assumptions of relative reliability and independent fact checking; and the obvious inferrence that the very high membership attrition and dissilusionment rate shows that the self-published Adidam material and assertions of adherents actually represents only a small minority of opinion (which others now believe as fact) among those who have been involved over time, and is not even that of a majority view of even the participants. This is why there is absolutely no justification for the claims that Adidam material should be given the requested exceptional consideration over secondary sources just because they tend to be more critical, which, as independent sources show, actually represents the majority and more neutral view regarding Adi Da and Adidam. --', '_line_number': 17}\n",

I am not prepared to assess yet whether two articles separating Adi Da and Adidam are better than one yet (although I understand Adi Da himself has said \"I AM Adidam\"), but regardless, you need something besides predominately self-published materials and they should be cited precisely and conservatively in this article to make a point. Adidam sources may say, for example, in the Adi Da article that Adi Da was an exhibitor at the Venice Biennale while not noting that this was actually a \"Collateral Exhibit\", a far less prestigious means by which less noted artists commonly seek exposure, a signficantly less significant and noteworthy accomplishment as documented in third party secondary sources, begging the question of how notable Adi Da really is as an artist. That is just an example of why self published sources on a subject according to Wikipedia should not dominate an article lacking secondary sourcing, and secondary sources are preferred where they exist. The burden of proof is on those providing self-published sources to establish such self-serving and suspect claims about, for example, Trungpa are valid and sufficiently significant, particularly when there is not evidence such claims are supported from primary or secondary sources associated with Trungpa himself (is there even any mention of Adi Da in anything associated with Trungpa other than Adidam sources?). Similarly, while Watts did write a forward for Adi Da\\'s first book, an autobiography, Watts died in poor health in November of 1973 without even meeting the then Bubba Free John and Adi Da only began his public mission at the end of April 1972, an insignficant period of time to assess his opinion regarding Adi Da or Adidam based on actual interactions or over the elapsed period since, and Wikipedia does not predict the future. Other than what is in the forward which is a pretty generalized endorsement of the first book (and the entire forward should be provided in the cite referencing this for context since it is linkable), you find nothing in the published or posthumous materials of Alan Watts or his biographers indicating that Watts endorsed Adi Da\\'s organization or subsequent actions nor has the Watts family said anything positive to say about Adi Da or Adidam in print.

The same applies to any source - all should be applied purposively and yet \"discriminatively\" - and the result should be a lucid distillation that really does cohere. If the article is sub-standard, and it is, then a thoroughgoing evaluation of the use of sources is what needs to be applied.

As to \"prestige\" and the noteworthiness of the exhibition itself, and Adi Da Samraj\\'s art in general, there is a great deal indeed that can and should be cited in support of this.

This is an example of why secondary sources are needed and preferred. Self published sources are not considered as reliable as secondary sources in matters of assessing notability in a given area either. One significant question is this: \"Adi Da is an artist, but is Adi Da sufficiently notable as an artist on his own to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia based on his art, or does not his primary notability come from his being a controversial guru rather than artist?\" Secondary sources suggest the latter. That Adi Da is an artist whose work was exhibited as a collateral entrant at the Venice Biennale is a conservative statement and secondarily sourced, more subjective claims from self-published materials are suspect and probably not appropriate in the text of this encyclopedia. For example, the current statement: \"These are typically produced at a so-called \"monumental scale\", as he describes, to eliminate the ego\\'s need to objectify the reality they convey\" is subjective and POV rather than objective fact. A more neutral and conservative statement would be \"these are typically produced at a so-called \"monumental scale\" to eliminate what he considers to be the ego\\'s need to objectify the reality they convey\". Regarding referencing Trunpa, I believe the quote generally accepted was something along the lines of Trunpa saying regarding Adi Da that \"it was difficult to start a new religion\". In an article limited by the relative lack of secondary sources, and lacking anything reliably sourced from Trunpa himself or some more objective third party source indicating an actual endorsement beyond such a statement, which is not only a historical truism taken at face value but open to multiple interpretations, given that the two never even met, the self published sources do not justify encyclopedia language implying an endorsement and are so tangential as to seem to lack sufficient relevance for inclusion, period. Whereas the secondarily sourced Wilber\\'s endorsements and subsequent redactions and Fuerstein\\'s endorsements and subsequent criticisms at least in part would be sufficiently relevant because they met and Wilber and Fuerstein were very clear about their endorsements, the context, and their intended scope. In summary, primary, self published sources that contain claims should provide commensurate evidence and must meet the criteria I see comesincolors has copied from Wikipedia above, including the requirement that the article is not based primarily on such sources as confirmed by the earlier RFC.

Also, note that Wikipedia does not have articles on every collateral artist associated with past or present Vienna Biennales. The point is that a brief mention of his art in a biographical article based on relative notability as a contemporary, controversial guru seems reasonable to me since that is where he\\'s put a lot of effort recently, provided the tone is neutral and conservative, but as an artist, there is a dearth of evidence of sufficient notability in the art world outside of Adidam to justify much more. Adidam consists of a few thousand who naturally consider everything Adi Da does as having great divine significance and his explanations about his art relevatory, but that opinion is only held by a very small minority. The fact that Adi Da has independent means to pursue an artistic career and may find some curators who showcase his work does not constitute proof of sufficient notability in the art world lacking a significant number of secondary sources asserting it so. Wikipedia policy is not to be used for promotional purposes, either to gain publicity for a future event contrary to Wikipedia policies such as was tried with the Vienna Biennale reference before it even happened, or to promote Adi Da as an artist beyond his true notability in the collective art community by undue weight in Wikipedia, and more critical third party secondary sources should also be included for balance. It is not my opinion that primary Adidam sources are suspect based on the criteria listed in SELFPPUB, it is clear from Wikipedia itself. We are talking here about a biographical article up to encyclopedia standards based on the subject\\'s actual notability as a guru based on secondary sources, which per Wikipedia needs to be substantially based in secondary sources not just self-published Adidam material, and perhaps the proposed separate article on the New Religious Movement Adidam which consists of only a couple thousand formal members based on independent sources and which is not well known outside of new age circles per independent secondary sources, and that is notable primarily for its claims that Adi Da is the first fully Divine Incarnation in history, clearly contentious and hardly the maintream POV Wikipedia emphasizes. A lack of secondary sources in a critical area where only Adidam sources exist to support the claim means, as Wikipedia itself states: \"Zero information is preferred to misleading or false information\". I think there is more than enough out secondary sourcing out there to make this article work, and see no reason you can\\'t fit in essential elements of Adi Da\\'s life and Adidam teachings within those constraints without violating SELFPUB, and the external link to Adidam is always there if readers want more Adidam based perspective.

I believe if you were to take the time to evaluate the primary sources on Adi Das \"Transcendental Realism\" art, youd see that the scope of his studio practice is very considerable by any standard. Similarly, the manner in which Adi Da Samraj presents his art in his broader context of spiritual initiation is complex in format as well as rigorously elaborated in terms of a precise philosophical argument. Adi Das argument concerning the transcendence of point of view in art dovetails with references to Cezanne, Kandinsky and Alberti in a manner that is not at all trivial and that is predicated on much, much more than \"great divine significance\" not that Im contending, of course, that the subject of what is of \"divine significance\" is irrelevant to his avocation. When you say \"it is not my opinion that primary sources are suspect based upon the criteria listed in SELPUB, it is clear from Wikipedia itself\" what youre asserting is doubtless irresistibly sunny; what is \"not your opinion\", on the other hand, bears examination. \"Suspect\" what a broad and suggestive brush. Similarly, your citing of Wiki\\'s \"Zero information is preferred to misleading or false information.\" Here\\'s a rule that has an intrinsic meaning such, that when you use it only for the meaning that you intend - a suggestive but otherwise insubstantial one - then I, for one, demur. If there is likely \"misleading of false\" information abroad, then what that information is needs to be established clearly, whatever the potential source may happen to be. Regardless, where is your actual evaluation, even in summary, of Da Plastiques sources, generic and Biennale Eventi Collaterali exhibition websites, and the printed catalogues and literature? I notice that you have exhorted other editors to \"try to follow Wikipedia guidelines, including the evaluation of sources for statements within the article.\"\" Going by your by your arguments on Watts and Trungpa and other sources earlier on, I gather that you take this very seriously; so I take it that you realise that \"evaluating\" means being more than simply suggestive concerning those sources that are not to your taste.', '_line_number': 70}\n",

I think if you were, you might start to glean an idea of the scope that a \"neutral and conservative\" paragraph on Adi Das art might encompass. Yes, Da Plastique has found \"some curators\" to exhibit Adi Das art. And yet, as you no doubt realise, not all curators are created equal. If youre in any doubt as to the notability of curators and critics who have embraced Adi Das art, I think you may be in for a surprise as the article evolves. I dont believe theres any doubt that notability in this instance doesnt mean being a Jeff Koons, or even of being of lesser renown either; it doesnt even mean being written up in Artforum or some such. Notability does, in this instance, mean that not only has the art has received serious attention from cognoscenti of very more than passing renown, but serious, sustained engagement from them for good measure.', '_line_number': 71}\n",

Regardless, applying fair as distinct from undue weight is a matter of using \"conservatively\" what is reasonable and purposive based upon available information not upon engineering balance for its own sake. To use an example, the mere statement \"Angels in America\" opened at the Mark Taper Forum to widespread critical acclaim is demonstrably balanced and would likely to continue to be so, even without reference to the say, an objection by a conservative critic who admired Ronald Reagan to the dramatists depiction of some of his friends. If it was the case that critical reception of Adi Da Samrajs art had been divided, or if there was significant demurral on its merits from a notable source, fine neither happens to be the case. Still, by any measure, the article should be and need only be conservative and plain, and not at all effusive. But the context viz. notability should be what critics and curators not affiliated with Adi Da Samraj have said and done.

Even so, heres something thats useable in an article; likewise, the fact that Watts praised but never saw Adi Da Samraj ought to be included. You say Watts died in poor health in November 1973; I understood more than that, that he died on his way to meet Adi Da at Persimmon as it then was. Regardless, you contend that that Watts had \"\"an insignificant period of time to assess his opinion regarding Adi Da or Adidam.\" That would imply that you had a notion, or evidence, concerning what prompted Watts to make his statements in the first place; a notion that took precedence over the ability of the referencer to draw her or his own conclusions. \"Wikipedia is not a crystal ball\", I think you said somewhere; to the best of my knowledge, it isnt a sance medium either, whether the Seer is in the house or not.

Fortunately for literature Verlaines view prevailed. So saying, thats less a point about literature or about a poets intimates, than about something that should be self-evident: a familys feelings are not a measure of a writers intentions. All in all, the fact that Watts never saw Adi Da Samraj might be echoed in the article by the fact that Trungpa never met him either. You say \"regarding referencing Trunpa, I believe that the quote generally accepted was something along the lines of Trunpa saying regarding Adi Da that \\'it was difficult to start a new religion.\\'\" (I think rather, as I suggested earlier, \"a new tradition.\") As earlier noted, Trungpa said that he regarded Adi Da to be \"genuine.\" Again, though Trungpas comment was pointed, it was not effusive.

Those judgements must be made by the editorial staff of the publication concerned; anything else opens up a veritable Pandoras box of subjectivity. The only basis on which such a contentious judgement could be made would be one which included an impeachment of the general quality of the source publication, The Austin Chronicle, and the assertion of a claim that it should no longer be regarded as a reputable high-quality source. No one, including Gwen Gale, has seriously advanced that claim. In any case, the article makes it clear that the journalist author of the article consulted numerous sources in compiling it.

The coasts had long been within Greek consciousness; colonies had been founded in the archaic period, while rich Athenians like Thucidides had exploited the gold and silver resources of the hinterland. Before the fourth century, however, Macedonia may have been regarded as a fringe area, and during that century Athenian politicians were able to deny, when it suited them, that the Macedonians were Greeks. Once the Macedonians became a threatening power, some Greek writers represented them as in almost every way un-Greek. It is likely, however, that the ruling Argeadai were more or less fully hellenized from at least the fifth century, when we see them establishing cultural links with the southern Greeks. The kings claimed descent from Zeus; Alexander I took part in the Olympic games, apparently the first Macedonian to do so, persuading the judges of his Greekness by enumerating his ancestors back to the kings of Argos. There seems to have been a presumption that ordinary Macedonians, despiute their dialect, were not as Greek as their kings. - Herodotos describes Amyntas (c. 500) as \\'a Greek ruling over Macedonians\\' - but despite ancient and modern controversies it seems clear that the Macedonians as a whole were Greek-speakers.\"', '_line_number': 39}\n",

Some people eat chili all by itself, some use it in combination with other spices and some use it in combination with various foods. It\\'s still chili. An article about chili can describe what chili is, and have single paragraphs about how it is used in various combinations because of various differences in tastes and cultures. The same goes for alternative medicine. The methods are exactly the same, but people use them differently for various reasons, which can be explained in individual sections. I prefer the present article, since it is at the basic level - the methods themselves. The various reasons for applying them differently are perfectly logical sections in this article. -- ', '_line_number': 4}\n",

And, given the correct point that that was a tax \"cut\" (I am amazed how many Americans don\\'t know this), the colonists, from this perspective, were incredibly stingy people who elevated their cheapness by calling for \"revolution.\" Like going to the Supreme Court to fight a parking ticket.

Tax law is just something that affects everyone, and in the case of the taxes specifically chosen to impose on the colonists at this time, were intentionally placed on items that all levels of income would have to pay to send a message, and therefore got the most attention as examples of unjustified law. At the core of the whole thing is the right to pass laws, the right to representation, and the percieved denial of rights guaranteed - first discussed as guaranteed to colonists under the English Bill of Rights but later discussed by revolutionaries as God-given rights. Again, I never said this article is perfectly balanced, but the rationale given in the first anon. post was no rationale at all. I am glad Jack takes note that virtual representation theory is noted, but I certainly wouldn\\'t mind more on that excuse by Parliament for passing colonial law, and more clarity on the American republican (small \"r\") position, if someone wants to add it. I realize these may be fine points of political theory for many readers of the article, and that it may seem to make little difference in the modern context, but to contemporaries this was a big deal and - in fact - the core of what makes the whole thing \"revolutionary\".

You continue to imply that I want readers to try anal sex, when I am actually indifferent on the matter and it is you who perhaps has some personal feelings about anal sex.

Pain sometimes being due to psychological factors is discussed in the references citing such pain. Pain from anal sex is sometimes partly due to psychological factors or completely due to it, similar to dyspareunia in men or women (though dyspareunia is more common in women), and dyspareunia is mentioned in at least two of the sources about anal sex pain included in this article.

The Jennifer Warner quote does not warrant inclusion in the section about salaries. The context of her quote has nothing to do with salaries. She's just a ticked off neighbor, not an expert providing insights into AiG's organization. Stern and his organization deserve a mention in the article because those familiar with AiG know the Australian Skeptics and AiG frequently exchange words. I agree with Ashmoo that mentioning Ken Ham's salary is ok, but to pretend that Jennifer Warner is a reputable source or that Ken Ham's salary should be compared to that of another CEO who is a volunteer without a salary is silly and doesn't deserve mention in an encyclopedia entry. I agree with JoshuaZ's comment. Even if this isn't OR (which it is), it doesn't deserve mention. I am not aware of any websites or news articles that criticize AiG because of Ken Ham's salary.

I am not sure what country you are from or what your employment experience is, but this kind of salary is not untypical in the United States. Personally, if I had the ability to take a position similar to Ken Ham's in exchange for his salary, I would pass.

That postulate (if you\\'d like) states that his salary is not excessive in response to what was obviously something that was criticised. Ham says his salary is not. Someone asked for a quote where someone said that it was excessive, and Warner\\'s quote, regardless of her leanings (any critic can be shown to have bias--that\\'s why they are a critic, they are against that given POV), said that AiG USA was \"in it for the money\". So we have two differing viewpoints reported and sourced(which I think is more fair than showing multiple sources for one opinion over the other--see below). Guidestar is linked from the AiG website as a source for \\'financial information\\' [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/about.asp] (so using information from there could not be considered formulating an analysis, but rather a collecting of information from the primary source to which AiG links). The comparison of salaries doesn\\'t seek to do anything more than show other religious organizations on similar standing/popularity/size. Nowhere do I state that he makes more than average or makes too much. If you draw that conclusion, it\\'s because facts bear that out for you, not because I said so. If you have other major religious organizations that show their CEO\\'s salaries, please do include a couple more for comparison. The ICR one is Creationist, and the FotF is theological based.

Also i\\'d like to point out, that alot of the \"FACT\" sections that come after the \"CLAIM\" sections are not facts, but interpertations of the facts.

Another one \"Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 32 Ancient and Accepted Primitive Rite Grand Orient of France The Secret Doctrine\" is rebutted as saying \"This is conflating two things: one, the Antient and Accepted Primitive Rite was started by John Yarker in the United States, and had nothing to do with the Grand Orient of France.\" however it\\'s been pointed out over and over to me that the secrets vary from lodge to lodge, and that nobody in one lodge can possibly know what the secrets of another lodge are.

From its ancient foundations and throughout its traditional practice, astrology has been concerned with predicting forthcoming weather, the direction of the winds and general meteorological conditions. The practical application of this is largely a part of what is known as mundane astrology (meaningearth-related), although as a philosophical principle it is embedded into the basis of natal astrology too. Ptolemys \"Tetrabiblos\" for astrology, (the defining text of traditional western asstrology), sets out a defense of astrology that assumes that individuals are characterised by the humoral quality of the prevailing air or ambience which defines their predominant humour, in the same way that a plant has suitability to a certain season or meteorological condition.

Thats why Latin titles of older astrology works such as\" De judiciis astrorum\" were translated into English as Judgment of the Stars. The Greek word planet was used to distinguish the \\'moving stars from the \\'fixed stars\\', as I explained when I inserted the text for footnote 3: The Greek phrase \"plntes astres\" \\'wandering stars\\' was applied to the seven visible planets (including the Sun and Moon) because of their observable movement against the \\'fixed stars\\'.

All the features of the bass guitar are common with the treble guitar - defining characteristics of the double bass are missing and we have a statement from the parents of the creature that it is a guitar. The gun has smoke coming from it. The only person denying the clear and obvious here is yourself. There is no misrepresentation of luthiers - only a clear recognition that the model they used, of all the models available to them, is that of the guitar. Every feature of the electric bass guitar is in common with the electric guitar - this is not true of any other stringed instrument family. This is what they call a slam dunk.

Locked: In this context most people would understand that to mean cannot be changed without some degree of difficulty or access. 2. Understanding of Taxonomy: I really did not want to go down this path but my education includes not only arts and music performance but a B.Sc majoring in biology and M.Sc in Botany. One of my masters papers was an exercise which reviewed an impact on plant taxonomy of different theories on plate tectonics and the expanding earth theory. Additionally my field and laboratory research lead to the need to create a new genus (not just species) mainly based on my histology of the fruiting bodies of a Rhodophyte (red alga). By all means try and find holes in my argument and state your own opinion and why you disagree, but please don\\'t insinuate I do not understand the principles of evolution and taxonomy. That is getting dangerously close to an \"ad hominem\" attack. The evolution and taxonomy argument you champion is based on what I consider a false assumption, your assertion that the designers went straight from guitar to bass. I have provided evidence as to why this is not so. 3. The low radius fingerboard was covered with the fretted fingerboard examples and photograph of the 1935 Rickenbacker and dismissed. 4. The \"clear legal documentation\" has never been denied, it is noted as a curious and entertaining footnote in electric bass history and has been dealt with every time you raise it. Moreover it was dealt with in 1952 by the Fender Company itself and possibly the man who drafted the patent application when the instrument was manufactured and supplied with accompanying distribution documentation and user manuals which all said Electric Bass. It was undeniably dealt with when the Electric Bass label was applied to the headstock of Jazz Basses. 5. I am glad you recognise the instrument as being a creation of luthiers rather than simply \"guitar makers\". 6. I have repeatedly stated the features an electric bass shares with a double bass. Read the discussion and you will find them. Maybe before that you can count the strings on the standard electric bass, note the standard tuning and the music played and that the musicians playing the instrument are bassists. Compare that with a Double Bass. Maybe you are right, not a \"single\" characteristic - there\\'s \"four\" right there. --', '_line_number': 12}\n",

You claim to understand taxonomy (I also have a degree in geological sciences) and yet, when given an example where every feature is inherited from a known parent, you choose to classify the bass guitar as being a member of a completely different family with which it has little in common. If this were a fossil, would you classify it in this way? More importantly, would you put a animal into a different classification based on enviroment alone? A whale is not a fish simply because it lives in the sea. It is not a giant marine reptile simply because it inhabits the niche they previously lived in. Similary, a bass guitar does not stop being a guitar based on the music people choose to play on it or the musical role they use it in. As I have pointed out, all bass stringed instruments have between 3 and 5 strings - and this \"is\" and example of convergent evolution. In the same way that whales and sharks have dorsal fins all bass stringed instruments seem to converge on this one point. Would you classify a whale as a kind of shark based on that one common feature? Of course not - or at least I hope you wouldn\\'t. Convergent evolution explains why two similar looking creatures are not related, you appear to be trying to argue the opposite, that because the bass guitar shares one convergent characteristic in common with the double bass, and often shares a niche with the double bass then it \"is\" a double bass.

Don\\'t let the conversation degrade to personal attacks because you simply disagree on a few points. Now let\\'s see what says: \"Questionable sources are those with a poor reputation for checking the facts, or with no editorial oversight. Such sources include websites and publications expressing views that are widely acknowledged as extremist, or promotional in nature, or which rely heavily on rumors and personal opinions. Questionable sources are generally unsuitable for citing contentious claims about third parties, which includes claims against institutions, persons living or dead, as well as more ill-defined entities. The proper uses of a questionable source are very limited.\" Harpie\\'s Bizarre qualifies as a questionable source because it appears to have no editorial oversight. Let\\'s contrast this with unreliable sources, such as IMDb, which has been proved inaccurate time and again, especially for biographical data about stars. By contrast, we don\\'t know how accurate Harpie\\'s Bizarre is. But can it be used to cite this claim? That depends on whether the claim is contentious. From the discussion above, it appears that the claim itself is not contested. The other editors have pointed out that the claim had no source at all. Now a source is provided, and it\\'s not cast as speculation or fan research, it\\'s a direct quote from an interview with the creator. It seems to me that in this case, HB is reliable for this particular quote from the creator, and might be used to weakly source the claim, in lieu of another definitely reliable source. In this case, HB is not relying on rumors, and it is quoting the personal opinion of an involved party, the creator of the series. Since this is not a contentious claim, I suggest you cite this article, leave a comment in the wikitext that you acknowledge it is a poor source, and move on. ', '_line_number': 10}\n",

Unfortunately I do not have a copy to confirm, nor can I make out what it is trying to say perhaps because it is written in English. Is this the only reference as it is the same one from the BAPS site and seems to be the only quote from an authentic scripture(Not confirmed). Even then the question arises that mahraj only mentioned Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar once which is recorded by Raghuvirji Maharaj. Why wasnt Gunatitanand Swami mentioned in the Vachanamrut, Shikshapatri, Satsangi Jeevan etc? Note those are the core scriptures, so surely an issue such as succession should be mentioned in there. Remember the Acharyas are mentioned in all 3 of those scriptures. If Raghuvirji Maharaj knew that Gunatitanand Swami was mool akshar then why not place his form next to swaminarayan bhagwan? Note he had ample time as he did perform murti pratishthas. Why did he never glorify Gunatitanand swami to be mool akshar? Why were the acharyas left in the hands of gopalanand swami surely they should be left in the hands of Gunatitanand Swami if he is Akshar! Why didnt Bhagwan Swaminarayan give gunatitanand swami the authority to perform murti pratishta? Why did Swaminarayan Bhagwan never mention that we should follow the gunatit parampara? Hypothetically let us say Gunatitanand swami is mool akshar. Has maharaj ever said place his murti next to mine? Has mahraj said accept him as my successor? Has mahraj said follow that line instead of acharays(as noted in the core scriptures)? This quote is from a side scripture(after mahrajs time), note when philosophical debates have occurred in the past then Vachanamrut and Shikshapatri have been referred to. Not even Satsangi Jeevan even though maharaj instructed shatanand swami to write it. Also you do not believe in the authority of the acharayas, if you say Raghuvirji mahraj was ok, then you forget one important thing. Raghuvirji maharaj did not follow Akshar Purushottam Upaasna nor did he acknowledge gunatitanand swami or pragji bhakta as spiritual successors to swaminarayan bhagwan, so for you to use Raghuvirjis scripture as evidence would seem rather redundant.

Rushton is a serious scholar who publishes in peer reviewed academic journals. Rushton is a professor at one of Canada's top universities. Rushton is a member of the American Association of Advancement of Sciences. Rushton is treated as an expert on CNN and Rushton's book was well reviewed by the New York Times. Further, Rushton only became controversial when he released a study claiming black men had larger penises than White men, and much larger penises than East Asian men. But he's not being quoted based on such controversial views. We are only quoting him to represent the view that you need to have most of your ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa to be black. This is an enormously common view about what it means to be black, so I don't see the problem with having a tiny section devoted to it, especially since we have an ENORMOUS section disputing it. Simply put, Rushton is the best source I know of that represents this major view point, and the article would be incomplete without that view point being represented. As for the claim that black people are monkeys. That's an extremely fringe view. Less than 1 in a 1000 people would seriously entertain that view and you would not find a scholary source in any area supporting it. But the view that most of your ancestors must be from sub-Saharan Africa to be black? That's actually a very middle of the road view. In fact in Latin of America they would go further and say ALL of your ancestors must be from sub-Saharan Africa to be black and call many of America's blacks mulattoes. \", '_line_number': 17}\n",

It's one of those terms that's implicitly understood but seldom discussed in a formal way. In fact the reason there has been so much debate in this article is because we have so few reliable sources to cite. But the reason I know Rushton's definition is mainstream is because it's so middle of the road. On the one hand you have many Americans saying if ANY of your ancestors are black you are black, but then you have Latin America going to the opposite extreme and saying if ANY of your ancestors are not black, you are NOT black. Rushton's right in the middle of the road by saying most of your ancestors must be from sub-Saharan Africa. He's essentially saying the same thing as the U.S. census map says however he's being clear about how much African ancestry you need so it's very easy for mixed race people to decide if they're black or not and giving us an alternative to the extremes of the one drop rule and Latin America's reverse one drop rule.

None of the dictionaries define blacks the way you want to define them, and even if we ignore English language and focus on genetics, the race you describe (i.e. Africans + Oceanic people) has no biological reality. And it was your definition that fixated on the black race, since your definition states at the outset that black is racial ethnic classification. And yes it's true that Africans have more genetic diversity than any other major racial group, but the split between Africans and non-Africans is the oldest, best confirmed, and most established split in human genetic history, so to try to deny that Africans form a genetic group is kind of pointless. And because there's o much diversity among Africans, there's really no need to include dark-skinned non-Africans, which itself is POV because as the black irish example showed, which one do you include and which ones you exclude. There's nothing wrong with the black race, so I'm not sure why people wish to water it down to the point where it doesn't exist or pretend it's only a social construction. You don't see white people doing that. They take pride in their racial heritage to the point where some believe you must be 100% white to be considered white. I don't see white people pretending to be related to people they're not related to. And South East Asians listen up. South East Asians need to take pride in their South East Asian ancestry. I suspect that calling themselves black (which very few of them do btw) is just a way for South East Asian youth to rebel against percieved European domination, associate themselves with the civil rights movement, or they're ashamed of their own heritage so they want to identify with a race that is often glamorized in sports and music videos.

Bob Dylan's own very often used imagery involving Jesus and Christianity is not evidence of conversion.

He was born a Jew and firm evidence should be required to dislodge him from that status, even temporarily. Not the fact that somebody said something in an offhand sort of way or that Gospel music was his passion during this time. Furthermore the period in question did not last very long. He was shortly into other musical styles. There are accountings of his re-involvement with Jewish rituals such as attending upon regularly recurring holidays of the Jewish calendar, since that time. And since that time he has moved on stylistically from Gospel music to other compositional styles, metamorphosing correspondingly into other personas.

Over time, formalisms like Backus-Naur form get refined by researchers and refactored and renamed, and the way they are taught over time changes. That is not the case with standards-track RFCs, which are defined by authoritative documents. A consensus process is used to name them, and after that there is huge pressure to preserve the name, and interoperability, over time.

Most base their \"understanding\" of the world in completely arbitrary views, imposed and self-imposed concepts that, even if not intentionally, serve the interests of keeping things as they are (and you have to agree with me... poverty, wars, an abysm between rich and poor, death everywhere... those are punctual consequences that, theoretically, don\\'t exactly appeal to a large amount of people). And if a mentality, a point of view, inevitably servers the purpose of keeping things as they are (and that can be concluded after doing minor evaluation of that specific mentality and admitting the simple implicit fact that consequences must have a cause -- no need for subjectivism here, since you don\\'t have to see too far to know someone must be poor for some other one to be rich) isn\\'t that point of view fake? Anyway, it seems very clear to me that the human race, considering we have rationality, making us, therefore, primarily social beings, can only truly coexist without the need for killing.

My point (A) above does \"not\" equate consensus with unanimity, although I would agree that we cannot easily achieve consensus on a great many issues. Consensus is a goal towards which to strive, and not a destination that we often reach. The best goals in life are of that nature - more-or-less unattainable, but worth striving for. The difference between consensus and unanimity is that someone\\'s concerns can be addressed without that person necessarily agreeing. Some people disagree with our core policies; those concerns are addressed at the project level, by the fact that Wikipedia is defined by its core policies. In the case of, say, a non-notable band article, a fan may want to keep the article, but may be unable to say why is at variance with the project. Whether or not they\\'re happy, their concerns have been addressed in the development and acceptance by the community of as a notability guideline. My points (C) and (D) do not contradict each other. I\\'m simply talking about cycle. A bold edit is great. A reversion is great. Any \"further\" edits made prior to thorough discussion constitute edit-warring. One does not \"continue\" to revert; one reverts once, and then discusses, bringing other, uninvolved eyes to the table as necessary. I don\\'t tend to communicate in terms of policy citations because I try to keep in my mind that Wikipedia is not a rules-based game. Cogent arguments always carry more weight than appeals to precedent, which is all that policy citations really are.

Bareau then concludes a plausible reason for this is that she may have died of puerperal fever soon after the death of Rahula and that was the real reason why Gotama became a renunciate, noting that the tradational four signs also make their first appearance in the Maha-vastu. So the reason why the Buddha's companions never knew or recorded her name when they all went to visit Suddhodana is because the poor woman had died long before the Awakening. --\", '_line_number': 25}\n",

These people might work for Berne Tourism or even might edit the official and administrative web-servers of Switzerland, and then, as they are \"supposed\" to translate and take care of English content, they just write \"Bern\" in English as they would do in their own language. The Website of the Canton uses in English \"Berne\". The city of the canton uses in English \"Berne\". Even the Embassy of the UK in Switzerland uses \"Berne\". To what it may be, England still \"owns\" the \"invention\" of English. And if it\\'s a matter of the number of speakers and then that in the US, they use \"Bern\", well then the Indian Embassy also uses \"Berne\" with an -e. We have to respect the original spelling of how it was intended to be and historically too. Diplomacy often used French for a long time, and you can look around Europe, where you have a French translation of a city, you might find some pretty similar translations into English when it doesnt vary radically: examples: Roma (DE), is \"Rome\" (FR/EN), Prag (DE) is \"Prague\" (FR/EN), Mnchen is \"Munich\" (FR/EN), Lisbon (EN) is closer to Lisbonne (FR) than Lissabon (DE), Copenhagen (EN) is closer to Copenhague (FR) than to Kopenhagen (DE) with a K-.

Even the only English-speaking Airline (Flybe) that goes to Berne Airport writes \"Berne\" on its website in English. I keep on saying that Wikipedia should refer to \"what it is in reality, officially\" and not \"what the majority of people think it is\". As for example, my village is found on GoogleMaps only in its German version. And 99% of the people there do speak French as a mothertongue. And GoogleMaps keeps on using the german name once introduced and not even \"official\" because the people who gave the maps of Switzerland have been german-speaking people who were having old facts about my village. Is it supposed to say that my village should be in English \"Illfingen\" instead of \"Orvin\"? The answer is definitely \"no\". The Canton itself names itself \"Berne\".

Many academic writings in English also share the same usage. Due to the nature of the English language, I slightly prefer the use of \"Wei (Cao)\" over \"Cao Wei\", since \"Wei\" is emphasized. Kingdom is an inaccurate reflection of the status of \"Cao Wei\"; actually, Wei (state) was closer to being a kingdom than \"Cao Wei\". \"Cao Wei\" is best classified as a \"state\" or \"polity\"; avoiding terms like kingdom, empire, dynasty etc. is a good NPOV decision when it comes to Chinese polities (unless it\\'s something like the Han Dynasty), since those terms have legitimacy POV connotations in the Chinese context. Calling \"Cao Wei\" a dynasty (but not Northern Wei) would elevate the polity to a status that\\'s not recognized in history versus Northern Wei, as argued by Nlu.
