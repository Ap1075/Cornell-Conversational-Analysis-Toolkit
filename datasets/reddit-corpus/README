Cornell Reddit Conversations v1.0 (released November 2018)

The file is 1.6G and in JSON format. It contains conversations from 100 highly active subreddits on Reddit (chosen heuristically by highest file size in raw Reddit API format). We selected 1,000 comment threads from each subreddit consisting of at least 10 comments each (except for the subreddit POLITIC which only contained 145 sufficiently-long threads), where a comment thread consists of a comment to a self post and all replies to that comment. The comment threads come those from the most recent self posts at the time the data was collected. In total, we collected 99,145 comment threads together consisting of 1,991,373 comments.

The JSON contains a list of comments. Each comment is a dictionary with the following attributes:

{
    "root": comment ID of the root of the conversation,
    "id": ID of the current comment,
    "reply-to": ID of the comment this comment is responding to (null if none),
    "text": text of comment,
    "timestamp": utc timestamp of comment creation,
    "user": username of user who wrote the comment,
    "user-info": dictionary with the following attributes:
        - subreddit, gilded, archived, score, retrieved-on, controversiality, edited, author-flair-css-class, downs, score-hidden, author-flair-text, distinguished, ups: as extracted from the Reddit API
        - self-post-id: ID of the self post this comment is in response to
        - post-deleted: whether this comment was deleted (by the user or by a moderator)
        - user-deleted: whether the user who wrote this comment was deleted
}
