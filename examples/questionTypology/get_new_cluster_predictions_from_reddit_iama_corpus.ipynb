      "\t\tAnswer 1. The answer to that question depends much on what you want out of a trip to Cuba. I think the first thing to think about, is if you will go to Cuba individually or with a group. For the first time in many years it is much easier to go to Cuba individually rather than in groups. Both have pros and cons. If you go by yourself you have the ability to go at your own pace and explore the things that interest you. The Cubans are very friendly and it is very easy to make friends and connect, and in my experience it is the safest country to travel in by yourself that I have every been to. So traveling by yourself will lead to great opportunities.\n",

      "The downside to solo travel is the time you spend discovering and setting up things and not having anyone experienced on the ground to put you in the right place at the right time. That’s where group travel comes in and that can really work out well if you pick the right organization to go with. I have been taking people to Cuba for about 10-years, teaching photo workshops there. My groups are fairly small in size and that is the one thing you want to be careful with, in picking who you go with. You do not want to be stuck with 30 other people on a bus for the entire trip. The biggest benefit with group trips is getting immediate access to things you would never ever be able to do on your own, being in Cuba for the first time. For example, I am able to get my groups into dance and music events and introduce them to my Cuban friends that create a very deep and emotional experiences that would take years to cultivate on your own.\n",

The Attack as a production company and show ranks right up there; lots of employees, massive studio build-out, several new productions that need infrastructure and pipelines created.

      "\t\tAnswer 3. When I worked for Senator Moynihan in DC, as a young legislative research assistant, I met a special agent from the DEA (it may have still been the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs - BNDD in those days). He was about to retire, and made a big impression on me -- his integrity compared to what I saw around me in the Congress. If you think the mean streets are rife with crime, the absence of ethics in Washington was staggering. (I'm not referring to Moynihan, who's integrity was unparalleled). \n",

      "\t\tAnswer 5. Definitely, the first three chapters are dedicated to the thought process and the struggle to figure out: should you start a business, what kind of business you should start, and when you should start it. The remainder of the book discusses the plans, the processes, and the tools needed to launch and scale a new business. The book also includes the Startup Roadmap and the Startup Funding Guide in the appendix. I hope this helps!\n",

      "\t\tAnswer 6. Thats a good question. My entire career has been based on trading commodities, FX and options. When I was first introduced to crypto, I was not really interested as it was far from the traditional financial products I was used to. Once I got more understanding of it and especially of the blockchain technology, I got \"the bug\" so to speak.  My advice on getting into it is not to look at the \"moon missions\" but to get a better understanding of what the technology is trying to achieve. Join the communities, talk to people involved and then of course, never invest money you can't afford to lose. \n",

      "\t\tAnswer 7. I didn't know I always wanted to write a novel! In fact if you'd asked me five years ago I would've said that I'd probably write a book of essays or some kind of cultural/sociological kind of non-fiction book. But I'm really glad I did. In terms of advice — you just HAVE to carve out the time. I think I talked about this on the podcast, but my general feeling about this is that no chunk of time is too small. It's really easy to say to yourself, well I just don't have those hours each day to devote to my book, but honestly, if you can even find half an hour each day to work on it, you'd be surprised at how much you can get done. I also find that when I DON'T have a lot of time, I'm often more productive. The most important thing for me is to turn off the internet while I'm trying to write — I use the Freedom app for this purpose. (It disables your internet.)\n",

I was watching A LOT of Law & Order (this was the days when TNT would have 3 - 5 hours a night) and being that deep into the rhythm / structure of the show made me think, \"Oh this would be really funny if I turned it into a coloring book.\" Also, the juxtaposition of \"dead bodies & banal courtroom procedure\" + \"something made for kids.\"\n",

      "\t\tAnswer 13. Well it really depends on the person. The government took some pity on me and I have medicaid, but absolutely zero copays on anything. Which ranges from my mental health apts and meds all the way to my 2000$+ surgery for my wisdom teeth. That's been a real help. They also give me enough foodstamp money so I can eat all month solely from that and it's truly been a lifesaver. \n",

People I used to hang out with seemed to think it was some rebellious no parents fad that they could profit off of with me, while their parents would yell at me for talking to them because I was some sort of horrible bad influence. I've had a lot of people immediately just put me in that box, of rebellious bratty teenager. It's frustrating, considering how hard I've been working for years now to achieve what their own kids didn't despite their advantages.

I'm NOT a motivational coach or speaker. You can motivate someone with a Red Bull. My view is that the most important part of being a human being is your \"being-ness\", that is to say in every moment of every day you are expressing some \"way of being\", e.g being frustrated, being confident, being compassionate. If you look back in your life you had a much wider range of those states of being than you do now, i.e. you are a more polarized version of yourself. I work with people to expand their expression and experience of themselves. ONE of the best ways for them to do that is by taking the action consistent with the way of being they are out to have a breakthrough in. In short, you can expand your experience and expression of yourself by understanding where you usually back away or resists and, with the right coaching and strategy, cause new results for yourself.\n",

What you need to consider is how much battery capacity you have, how car can you go while traveling a certain speed with your given capacity and what is the minimum speed you need to achieve to ensure you complete the competition under the given constraints.

      "\t\tAnswer 26. This is something we see multiple times per day in our office. It is likely a condition known as urticaria (A.K.A hives.) The palms of hands and soles of feet are a common area to experience increased itching. Hives occur in over 25% of the general population, and well over half just happen without known trigger. Any hives lasting over 6 weeks is called \"chronic urticaria.\" Unfortunately, antihistamines are still the first line of treatment. You can get a dermatologist to biopsy an active area to rule out other causes, but if they are responding to Zyrtec the biopsy will probably just show \"hives.\" More than likely there is no specific cause (not detergents or foods, or any other lifestyle changes) it is just your body. There are some factors that can increase symptoms such as NSAIDs (ibuprofen, Advil, aspirin, etc.), alcohol, heat, stress, so limiting these as able may help some. You can also bump up to more than one Zyrtec per day when needed (up to 4). If it continues, there are injectable medications such as Xolair that can be used once a month through an allergy specialist or dermatologist. \n",

      "\t\tAnswer 1. The answer to that question depends much on what you want out of a trip to Cuba. I think the first thing to think about, is if you will go to Cuba individually or with a group. For the first time in many years it is much easier to go to Cuba individually rather than in groups. Both have pros and cons. If you go by yourself you have the ability to go at your own pace and explore the things that interest you. The Cubans are very friendly and it is very easy to make friends and connect, and in my experience it is the safest country to travel in by yourself that I have every been to. So traveling by yourself will lead to great opportunities.\n",

That’s where group travel comes in and that can really work out well if you pick the right organization to go with. I have been taking people to Cuba for about 10-years, teaching photo workshops there. My groups are fairly small in size and that is the one thing you want to be careful with, in picking who you go with. You do not want to be stuck with 30 other people on a bus for the entire trip. The biggest benefit with group trips is getting immediate access to things you would never ever be able to do on your own, being in Cuba for the first time. For example, I am able to get my groups into dance and music events and introduce them to my Cuban friends that create a very deep and emotional experiences that would take years to cultivate on your own.\n",

      "\n",
      " * When you create a business (selling something online, for instance) you're automatically deemed a Sole Proprietor, unless you file a form claiming to be something else, such as an LLC or Corporation. There are pros and cons to each type of classification, and filing requirements will vary from state to state. Using a service like LegalZoom is probably the easiest option. If you're selling physical goods, I imagine there may be additional permits and licenses required. Always best to do a lot of research beforehand. \n",
      "\n",
      " * By 'working with Google' I assume you mean show up in the search results? Our websites are on Wordpress and use a plug-in called Yoast SEO to help with that. [Here's a post of his](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/submit-sitemap-search-engines/) that explains some details. You can also [submit your website to Google here](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url?continue=/addurl).\n",

      "\t\tAnswer 5. A temp employee who wasn't trained turned it on. So we didn't use any LOTO.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly don't know how the liability thing works but there were a lot of failures from the company, my boss, and myself.

The body is bigger, heavier and you will have a much higher aerodynamic and rolling resistance. What you need to consider is how much battery capacity you have, how car can you go while traveling a certain speed with your given capacity and what is the minimum speed you need to achieve to ensure you complete the competition under the given constraints.

Educated people are more likely to have a better future for themselves, for their families, for their communities, for their countries and eventually the entire world.

There is a direct corrolation between the economies of different countries and the level of education in those countries. The more educated people a country has, the more advanced it is.
