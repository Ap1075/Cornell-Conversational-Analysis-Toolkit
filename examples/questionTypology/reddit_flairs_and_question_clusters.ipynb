      "Thanks again!\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. This type of advice should always be consulted from a lawyer, as there are many varying factors. That being said, here's a brief explanation to the best of my knowledge (in the United States): \n",
      "\n",
      " * When you create a business (selling something online, for instance) you're automatically deemed a Sole Proprietor, unless you file a form claiming to be something else, such as an LLC or Corporation. There are pros and cons to each type of classification, and filing requirements will vary from state to state. Using a service like LegalZoom is probably the easiest option. If you're selling physical goods, I imagine there may be additional permits and licenses required. Always best to do a lot of research beforehand. \n",
      "\n",
      " * By 'working with Google' I assume you mean show up in the search results? Our websites are on Wordpress and use a plug-in called Yoast SEO to help with that.

During my internship I saw that my hands worked well and noticed that my highest aptitude was in surgery. When I saw a lecture on nose jobs (rhinoplasty) I was impressed by the immediate change the surgery made. That was when I first thought about plastic surgery as a profession for me. \n",

      "\t\tAnswer 7. I don't think that's relevant for me - I didn't market my own games, I've always worked for companies or clients who either handled that, or in the cases of some games, gave them away for free to the people who needed them.  \n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. How did you approach the different restaurant owners about doing a story? Did you just walk in or schedule a time to come?\n",

Meryl: I first found out about it when the director called me up at home and said--I didn't even know he had my phone number--but he said, \"This is Stephen Frears,\" and I said, \"Oh! God! I love you!\" And he knows I love him, because we almost worked together a couple of times. He said, \"I have a film for you,\" and I said, \"Yes, I'll do it. Yes. Definitely yes.\" He said, \"Don't you want to know what it is?\" And, he said it was a story about Florence Foster Jenkins, and I had known about her since I was a student, so I was thrilled.

      "The slowdown of Western Canada's economy might increase drug abuse as the slowdown continues. I feel that the economic ripples from the oil crash are getting stronger, indirectly, as the savings of individuals run out and spending decreases. Do you fear that the number of Fentanyl deaths will increase due to this general slowdown of the western canadian economy? What do you think our best tools are for counter-acting this trend?\n",

      "The linkage between drug abuse and the health of an economy is complex. Certainly drug use is seen poor economies where the despair or unemployment is managed through drug use. This is certainly seen in the rural US where prescription drug abuse is rampant in cities and towns hardest hit by economic downturn. Could that occur in Western Canada and oil patch related communities...potentially.\n",

What do you think will happen to the conservative base of the Republican party if Trump becomes President? Do you foresee the rise of multiple, smaller parties in our near future? Or do you think the R's and the D's will reabsorb those who have been disenfranchised by a Trump administration? I wonder as millennials come of age how much they will adhere to voting purely party, or if they will branch out to more moderate and independent platforms. \n",

You're a great role model & you've got your stuff together. \n",

I'm NeverTrump, and I believe that if Trump becomes president, the Republican Party is the same as European right-wing parties, which are nativist, xenophobic and big government.

      "\t\tAnswer 5. Mixed insect flour only makes sense from a cost point of view, once we have spent years farming several species of insects, perfected their feed and living conditions etc. It makes more sense to focus on one or two insects, and do that well. I also don't think it would sell any better than a single insect flour at the moment, as people would raise even more question marks as to what is actually inside that bag. Nutritionally yes, it could make sense to blend up the different insect parts to make up an 'ideal nutritional profile'. It's an interesting idea for sure :-)\n",

      "\t\tAnswer 6. I would say you will never get 40 mph off of a 1 kW array when in the cruiser class. The body is bigger, heavier and you will have a much higher aerodynamic and rolling resistance. What you need to consider is how much battery capacity you have, how car can you go while traveling a certain speed with your given capacity and what is the minimum speed you need to achieve to ensure you complete the competition under the given constraints. With that said, you will likely be consuming 12-18kW depending on vehicle build configurations to maintain 40 mph on a level surface.\n",

      "\t\tAnswer 7. I believe that higher education should be a basic right, and not a privilege. Educated people are more likely to have a better future for themselves, for their families, for their communities, for their countries and eventually the entire world. The more educated people we have, the more entrepreneurship we will see, the more advanced the different economies will become. There is a direct corrolation between the economies of different countries and the level of education in those countries. The more educated people a country has, the more advanced it is. Moreover, I believe that educated people have a bright future in front of them, and as such they are more likely to be productive members of society and strive for peace. I believe that education is the best ingredient for world peace. \n",

There are some fantastic applications of this technology (such as WorldLens) that show what the future could be where you could navigate the world without knowing a second language, but the experts believe truly seamless and accurate machine translation technology will take a while.

Though, according to users of our bracket game, we're getting closer to witnessing history. Last year, 5.68 percent of all brackets had a 16 seed over a 1 seed. That's a slight drop since the all-time high of 6.2 percent in 2015, but the percentage is trending upward since 2011, when it was just 1.74 percent.

I can't speak for all the replacement batteries out there, but ours are made to the same specifications and ratings as an OEM part and we're pretty obsessive about maintaining quality and backing it up with a good warranty.

It's really easy to say to yourself, well I just don't have those hours each day to devote to my book, but honestly, if you can even find half an hour each day to work on it, you'd be surprised at how much you can get done.

      "\t\tAnswer 9. Great question. At my highschool we used *Fundamentals of Java™ AP® Computer Science Essentials / Edition 4* (ISBN: 0538744928) as our main course resource. I thought following the book did an alright job but I always felt as if my teacher at the time could have delivered it better. To learn a new chapter and concepts, we'd go through a couple PowerPoint slides outlining the chapter, go through some program examples as a class that's she'd walk us through, then be given 3 or so projects/assignments to complete in class only. Each chapter and the description I gave of how we accomplished it was across the span of about a week to a week and a half each. I quickly learned that if I didn't start tutoring myself at home I'd fall behind real fast since new concepts constantly build on top of older ones. It just felt rushed in my opinion. 39 minutes a class (1 hour every 9 school days as we had a rotating hour class schedule) every day just didn't seem like enough to fully grasp Java.\n",

      "I'd say my biggest challenge coming into a professional programming role from only have done C++ and Java *college-level* highschool classes, was being able to understand new code that was completely foreign to me and having to jump down the rabbit hole of different methods, managers, controllers, implementations, interceptors, etc. etc. All the different masks a Java class could wear using different enterprise code strategies was definitely a struggle as well just overall being exposed to what **real** java applications were like. I mean I'm talking thousands on thousands of lines of code with almost countless classes across so many java packages that all in random with a few back-end java services make up just one whole business process that could either be for consumer use or purely internal in itself. It was all pretty daunting to get used to coming from only having experience wiring up a handful of classes for a simple program! Learning Spring framework which is very common that we use on top of all our java was also a learning curve.\n",

      "I guess to answer your question, I think the whole curriculum is pretty well-rounded, I could go on to critique certain aspects of it but I feel as if I'd be biased from a web developer's point of view. I wanna say it lacks in preparing a student for the professional world in terms of what enterprise architecture is like what new and commonly used technologies that are being utilized across silicon valley *but* then again the curriculum is already throwing a lot at the average student to begin with. I will say the AP test I took at the end of my senior year was *COMPLETELY* out of line. I was totally and utterly shocked that as students who just finished a basic Java fundamentals class we were actually expected to *totally write out by hand* lines on lines of code as solutions to whatever scenario or question was being asked on that test. I thought I did atleast averagely alright and I didn't even score atleast one credit from it...\n",

      "\t\tQuestion 1. I'm planning on making my way to Cuba soon.  What advice would you give someone visiting Havana for a few days?  What should I definitely do and what things should I avoid?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. The answer to that question depends much on what you want out of a trip to Cuba. I think the first thing to think about, is if you will go to Cuba individually or with a group. For the first time in many years it is much easier to go to Cuba individually rather than in groups. Both have pros and cons. If you go by yourself you have the ability to go at your own pace and explore the things that interest you. The Cubans are very friendly and it is very easy to make friends and connect, and in my experience it is the safest country to travel in by yourself that I have every been to. So traveling by yourself will lead to great opportunities.\n",

      "The downside to solo travel is the time you spend discovering and setting up things and not having anyone experienced on the ground to put you in the right place at the right time. That’s where group travel comes in and that can really work out well if you pick the right organization to go with. I have been taking people to Cuba for about 10-years, teaching photo workshops there. My groups are fairly small in size and that is the one thing you want to be careful with, in picking who you go with. You do not want to be stuck with 30 other people on a bus for the entire trip. The biggest benefit with group trips is getting immediate access to things you would never ever be able to do on your own, being in Cuba for the first time. For example, I am able to get my groups into dance and music events and introduce them to my Cuban friends that create a very deep and emotional experiences that would take years to cultivate on your own.\n",
