    "* The `PhrasingMotifs` transformer extracts representations of utterances in terms of how they are phrased;\n",

On top of that , all 27 Heads of State and Government have made repeated commitments at European Councils that they are committed to defend the integrity of the single market .\n",

Why , therefore , have the Government effectively curtailed that right , and not even mentioned it in the circular on out - of - area treatments ? What is the Minister 's response to the president of the Royal College of Surgeons who , in last week 's New Statesman , said : It is terribly important that a GP can refer to the appropriate specialist centre . Yet the new system…makes that more difficult . That is very disappointing and not right for the highest standards of patient care… ?\n",

Why must they wait for some sort of lottery , which is governed totally by the Tories at Westminster , before they get the resources that they require ? Is not the best and most logical way to allocate resources to establish a proper regeneration programme for all cities and towns and to stop messing about with Government diktats ?\n",

In the meanwhile , I content myself with the observation that I notice that all education authorities in Wales have made sufficient provision in their education funding , despite their fears and claims beforehand , to ensure that the teachers ' pay increase is paid in full in each of the eight education authorities in Wales , and that they are now turning their attention to increasing allowances for councillors .\n",

I welcome the changes in inheritance tax because the industry obviously needs them , but does the Minister agree that over a range of agricultural changes introduced as a result of the common agricultural policy , it will be necessary to avoid preventing the achievement of major environmental access and recreational agreements ? The good work that the Minister has done in the past could be undone . Does the Minister agree that some steps will have to be taken to mitigate those effects ?\n",

The Secretary of State is fortunate in heading the Whitehall Department with the largest number of fast - track civil servants , so does he agree that if budget support is to work , Ministers in the receiving African countries must be able to work up their senior management teams so that they , too , can call on good - quality officials both to work up and deliver policy ?\n",

It is a major problem between those two countries and for that part of the world .

Is he aware that in the case of approximately half the homelessness diversions in the private rented sector , we are substituting affordable social housing for astronomical rents in the private rented sector ?

Will he therefore ignore the ignorant and politically correct pleas of a number of Labour Members who have asked him to cancel the Hawk order to Indonesia ?

    "\n",
    "One thorn in our sides might be that the model occasionally gets caught up on very generic motifs e.g., `'is>*'`, and as such, will fit many questions to the type containing `'is>*'` instead of going with a better signal; various optional parameters detailed in the documentation may provide incomplete solutions to this. Another caveat is that while this model allows us to associate together lexically-diverging phrasings (e.g., \"will the Minister admit\" and \"does the Minister not realise\" both serve to be accusatory towards the Minister), we are ultimately relying on the fact that our domain has a sufficient amount of lexical regularity (e.g., the institutional norms of how people talk in parliament) -- we might need to be cleverer when dealing with noisier settings where this regularity isn't guaranteed (like social media data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a data-specific note, cluster 7 may be a result of the parser assuming that \"Will the learned Gentleman please answer my question?\" has \"learned\" as the root verb -- an artefact of parliamentary discourse we haven't handled. You may wish to play around with this by modifying how the data is preprocessed."
