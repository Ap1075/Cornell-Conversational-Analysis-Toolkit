Is not part of the problem with cost down to the fact that we have companies that generate electricity selling it to themselves , which allows them to hike the prices paid by consumers ? People need those prices to come down in order to heat their homes . Why not just split those roles completely to ensure that we get an honest broker in the middle ?\n",

I suggest that he bide his time and wait until that question is reached . In the meanwhile , I content myself with the observation that I notice that all education authorities in Wales have made sufficient provision in their education funding , despite their fears and claims beforehand , to ensure that the teachers ' pay increase is paid in full in each of the eight education authorities in Wales , and that they are now turning their attention to increasing allowances for councillors .\n",

In 1989 , there were 432 secondments of more than three months ' duration from the civil service to industry , compared with 331 in 1988 .

It is certainly the case that the NATO summit will need to give a high priority to a reassertion of article 5 of the doctrine of collective defence .\n",

It is really important that when there are regimes that we do not wish to invite to this country , the relevant international sanctions should be in place to back that up . One of the ironies of the current process is that the ban put in place for the 1980 Olympics produced results for two people who did not abide by that ban , Lord Coe and Lord Moynihan , who are , of course , central to the delivery of the current games .\n",

We want to provide homes for Londoners . The present Mayor has an exemplary record in providing affordable homes—indeed , homes of all types—ahead of the targets , and the £ 400 million that is being invested in the 20 housing zones across London is a tribute to his tenacity .\n",

    "Inspecting the other types should hopefully give you an intuition for the range of questions that tend to be asked in parliament, as well as the coherence of these types (which align fairly well with the output of the paper, even under different random seeds and small implementation tweaks). \n",

    "### a few caveats and potential modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "One thorn in our sides might be that the model occasionally gets caught up on very generic motifs e.g., `'is>*'`, and as such, will fit many questions to the type containing `'is>*'` instead of going with a better signal; various optional parameters detailed in the documentation may provide incomplete solutions to this. Another caveat is that while this model allows us to associate together lexically-diverging phrasings (e.g., \"will the Minister admit\" and \"does the Minister not realise\" both serve to be accusatory towards the Minister), we are ultimately relying on the fact that our domain has a sufficient amount of lexical regularity (e.g., the institutional norms of how people talk in parliament) -- we might need to be cleverer when dealing with noisier settings where this regularity isn't guaranteed (like social media data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a data-specific note, cluster 7 may be a result of the parser assuming that \"Will the learned Gentleman please answer my question?\" has \"learned\" as the root verb -- an artefact of parliamentary discourse we haven't handled. You may wish to play around with this by modifying how the data is preprocessed."
