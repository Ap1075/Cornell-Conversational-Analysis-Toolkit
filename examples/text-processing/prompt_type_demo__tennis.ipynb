That's why they came up with that. I respect that. No problem. I'm probably one of the few players that they are looking carefully and see how much time I spend on the court.

Whenever you were over 185, you used to serve and volley back in the day because you would take advantage of your size, of your power. And now it's all these guys over 190 are actually playing further back in the court because they have more time, their serve is as big as it is, and they don't need to kill themselves always running back and forth over hours and hours. That I think is something that has really changed. And, of course, when you're tall like this, the serving, it helps the serving. But, you know, I don't think it's impossible for a smaller guy to succeed in today's game. I mean, Rafa, me, we're not the tallest out there. We're the norm, let's say. And that works perfectly well.

That's why they came up with that. I respect that. No problem. I'm probably one of the few players that they are looking carefully and see how much time I spend on the court.

Whenever you were over 185, you used to serve and volley back in the day because you would take advantage of your size, of your power. And now it's all these guys over 190 are actually playing further back in the court because they have more time, their serve is as big as it is, and they don't need to kill themselves always running back and forth over hours and hours. That I think is something that has really changed. And, of course, when you're tall like this, the serving, it helps the serving. But, you know, I don't think it's impossible for a smaller guy to succeed in today's game. I mean, Rafa, me, we're not the tallest out there. We're the norm, let's say. And that works perfectly well.
