I compliment my hon Friend on the pressure that she has exerted to ensure that the M25 is completed , but can she say whether any studies have been made on the introduction of flexibility and extra lanes , if required , as the traffic build - up , especially through my constituency , already suggests that that motorway will be heavily over - subscribed ? Will the existing arrangements be adequate ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. We have , of course , made provision in certain parts of the M25 for four - lane carriageways . I understand what my hon Friend is saying , but until we have completed the remainder—slightly less that 50 per cent.—of the M25 , there will be some unnatural flows of vehicles seeking to use the route in a different way . I must ask my hon Friend to be patient , but I assure him that we have the matter under serious consideration .\n",

Can the Minister please say when pits other than Asfordby are expected to be opened , bearing in mind that the existing pits in Leicestershire are closing and the huge reservoir of extremely valuable and necessary coal in the Vale of Belvoir ? Will it be before all the miners ' skills have disappeared from those pits , which are emptying of people ?\n",

There is a marvellous prospect at south Warwickshire and a tremendous development at Asfordby . Provided that the miners in the area continue the tremendous advances in productivity , their future is extremely bright .\n",

      "\t\tAnswer 3. I can only repeat my answer . An outline suggestion was put to us , but the matter has not been considered further and a heck of a lot of work would be needed before approval could even be seriously considered .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. Since we are facing a reduction in income in the most recent year obviously my right hon Friend will pin his hopes largely on a successful European settlement . May we also expect that he will be closely monitoring the clear squeeze between inflation on the one hand and the reduced revenue being experienced , particularly , by sheep and beef breeders ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. It would , of course , be wrong for me to anticipate the statement to be made by my right hon Friend later today . I can say that if the agreement reached by the Agriculture Ministers were agreed by the European Governments collectively it would be of considerable benefit to both sheep and cattle breeders in Wales .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. I welcome that response . Will the Minister reassure me that he will properly join up his work with that of the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Defence ? Like many other Members , I know of at least two veteran constituents who clearly need joined - up health and welfare . The voluntary sector helps—including the Matthew Project ’s new “ Outside the Wire ” service in Norfolk—and I expect the same of the Government , who have rightly signed the armed forces covenant .\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. My hon Friend makes an important point . This is not just about providing good health care services , but doing so in a joined - up way . We now have a seriously injured leavers protocol to help the transition of servicemen and women who leave the armed forces and return to civilian life . That is about taking a holistic view of their health and care needs , and any other needs that they may have , in providing the right support when they return to civilian life . It is being rolled out very effectively across the country .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 6. I welcome the expansion of screening programmes , but can the Minister be a little more precise about nationwide screening in respect of bowel cancer , which kills 17,000 people a year ? When does she expect to be able to roll out a nationwide screening programme , and when do the Government expect that sufficient staff will be trained in endoscopy to enable such a programme to be fully effective ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 6. We have run the first phase of a screening trial based in Nottinghamshire and we are reviewing the results . We are in the second phase of that trial , and as part of it we need to consider aspects such as hard - to - reach groups . We anticipate having some results by 2006–07 . In the meantime we are making £ 9 million available over three years to train more GPs , nurses , surgeons and gastroenterologists to meet the rising demand for endoscopy—that is a key issue—and we have established three national and seven regional centres to train medical staff in endoscopy .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. The Government reward the failure of the privatiser Steria , which lost £ 56 million of public money , in order to punish the success of the workers who have saved £ 120 million of public money . Will the Minister tell us who will decide whether those jobs will be offshored ? Will it be the Ministry of Justice or the Cabinet Office ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. My right hon Friend the Justice Secretary has made it absolutely clear that he does not support the offshoring of those jobs at Newport . Let me say to the hon Gentleman , however , that we will take no lessons from him or his party about the interaction of Government with the private sector . We are introducing far more discipline and rigour into our contracts with the private sector providers .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. Will the European fighter aircraft be a better aircraft than the Jaguar or the Tornado , 49 of which have been lost since 1979 at a cost of about £ 430 million ? Will the Minister tell us why we need these sophisticated aircraft when one can fly to Red Square in a single - engined Cessna ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. The hon Gentleman will find that the aircraft to which he refers are highly thought of , and our success in selling the Tornado overseas is testimony to the effectiveness of that aircraft .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. Given that cutting fuel bills and the use of energy is the best way of meeting the environmental challenge , when will Ministers be able to meet the target put forward by many groups last September of an energy efficiency rating of 81 out of 100 for our homes ? How many UK homes already meet that target ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. I am afraid that I am not carrying that number in my head , but I shall certainly write to the hon Gentleman about it . I shall also provide an answer to his query . I am not sure whether anyone has set a date by which they think that standard can be met , but it is an important point and I shall write to him about it .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. May I refer the Minister to what the Secretary of State said about the analysis that he has instructed the Scottish Development Agency to carry out ? Is he aware that the right hon and learned Gentleman gave the impression that clear and precise directions were given to the Scottish Development Agency ? But I have a letter from Mr. Scott , the chief executive , who says that the precise terms of reference of the remit for the study have yet to be settled . Exactly what will the Scottish Office involvement be in setting the final terms of reference ? Will the Minister give an assurance that the terms of reference will include the feasibility of an independent Scottish steel industry and that the preparation of a business plan to attract investment for that objective will not be ruled out ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 10. The terms of reference for the SDA were deliberately made extremely broad . They included the analysis of prospects for the steel industry , the identification of opportunities for it and the ability to assist the Government in the discharge of our responsibilities in relation to any possible contraction of the sector . The kind of detail to which the hon Gentleman refers is a matter for the SDA to resolve when it decides how to embark on its study .\n",

      "\t\tQuestion 1. As a significant proportion of all those who are convicted of terrorism are subsequently released only to commit fresh terrorist offences . , is it not common sense , as well as a means of discouraging violence in Northern Ireland , for them to be kept in prison for the duration of the emergency ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. I see no justification for saying that people should be sentenced and that their release should be dependent on the general security position in the Province or on a political decision of this House rather than be linked to the offence that they have committed .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 2. Notwithstanding his answer to the hon Member for Linlithgow ( Mr. Dalyell ) , does the Minister accept that a massive amount of incapacity benefit is not taken up ? Would he accept that there is therefore no reason to go ahead with the planned , but much opposed , cuts in the benefit ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 2. No , I do not accept that . Some people with an entitlement to disability living allowance do not claim it , for a variety of reasons—perhaps they do not know about the benefit , or perhaps they do not regard themselves as sufficiently disabled . We are always considering ways to ensure that the benefit is paid to those who are entitled to it . However , the hon Gentleman should also bear it in mind that 40 per cent . of those who claim disability living allowance do not meet the entitlement conditions . So encouraging more people to apply would simply mean that more were disappointed , and that the waiting time for people who need the benefit and who qualify for it would be even longer .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 3. As some people might die from the stress and strain of overwork and worry , might not early retirement save some lives ? Is it not dangerous to indulge in sweeping generalisations ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 3. It is valid to say that , whatever the link between unemployment , stress and mortality may be , there is certainly a link between employment , stress and mortality .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. As the police were walking about the place peacefully shortly after the disturbances may we get away from the obsession about no - go areas and ask ourselves why there was so much hostility to the police in the first place when the outbreak took place ? Is it not time that we began to consider community policing on a national scale rather than reactive policing , which was the cause of the riot ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. The conference to consider police operations might examine such questions . The Bristol incidents have been analysed fully . A full summary of the chief constable 's report is available in the Library . Inquiries will be made by the Select Committee of which the hon Gentleman is a member . It is well known that local authorities are examining the situation .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. Is that not an extremely innocuous reply in the circumstances ? As in England , the NCB sees fit , in its wisdom , to ask the mine managers ' union to give cover , while in Scotland it has decided not to request similar cover for maintenance and safety , will the Minister institute an inquiry , preferably public , into all the elements surrounding the problems affecting the Bogside closure on 3 February , so that there will be a halt to the NCB 's vindictive attitude in Scotland , which is causing disruption in the coalfield ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. I regret that the hon Gentleman should see fit to criticise the NCB management in any part of the United Kingdom on such a matter . I do not intend to intervene in a matter involving safety provision . That must be for the local NCB management and the active discussion of those involved .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 6. Does not the Secretary of State recognise the MX missile , the Tornado and the commitment to 3 per cent . per annum up to 1985 ? Surely this is not a one - sided issue .\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 6. No , it is not . Our 3 per cent . is matched by something like 4 per cent.—perhaps more—on the other side . They have been sustaining a programme of new weapon production for many years in all sectors on the other side of the Iron Curtain , as the hon Gentleman knows . It has never been , and is not , any part of our strategy to seek to match the Soviet Union weapon for weapon . What we and our allies require is a defensive capability that is adequate to deter .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. Would my right hon Friend concede that there is a lot wrong with the export credits guarantee scheme ? Is not the £ 800 million Iraqi debt an example ? Is not the contract in Malaysian ringgits—which , because of the devaluation of that currency , has cost the British taxpayer millions of pounds—another ? Can she say something about that ? Is there not too much emphasis on defence exports , which some of the countries concerned can ill afford , and not enough emphasis on the export of domestic goods ? Is it not time for reform ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. With great respect to my hon Friend , I have to say that , on balance , the ECGD system works well . I understand some of the concerns that he identifies . Obviously , devaluation has an impact to some degree , although payments continue to be made up to date . Some of the ECGD cover in Malaysia is ringgit - related , and so was not affected by the changes that he identifies . On defence exports and defence cover , although there are fluctuations from time to time—depending on the flow of contracts—he will find , on balance , that an average of only 14 per cent . of the cover that the ECGD supplies is for defence .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. Would the Minister accept that the alarming illiteracy figures suggest that the one language that is not necessarily taught as rigorously as it should be in schools is English ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. No , I would not accept that . I am sure that the hon Gentleman accepts that the number of young people leaving primary school and reaching the national standard in literacy and numeracy has increased by 100,000 a year . I am sure that he welcomes that improvement .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. Would the Minister for Sport accept an invitation from me to visit Kettering Town football club for its FA cup second round clash with Leeds United , when he might be able to discuss with the club and its fans potential Government support , through planning guidelines or finance , for the redevelopment of the stadium ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. I might take the hon Gentleman up on his offer , as the next game is against Leeds United , and Kettering beat Hartlepool 1 - 0 on Saturday . That shows that the Sport Minister is well informed . The serious point is that clubs such as Kettering Town act as a strong community focus , and if there are issues about planning or any other areas where we can offer support , we will do that .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. Would my right hon Friend accept that the fact that the euro has strengthened as a currency indicates that the markets believe that the weaker countries will not be able to push water up hill for much longer and are bound to drop out of the euro before very long ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 10. I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to comment directly on the value of the euro , but I would observe that we have a weak US dollar and that that may have had an impact on the value of the euro . As I said just now , it is important for us to focus on the task in hand , which is implementing the agreement most recently signed on 21 July by the eurozone . Of course we can and should have a discussion about the future of the euro and its governance arrangements—and that is important—but the euro is here to stay and we have to ensure that it works for Europe . I do not want Britain to be part of the euro , and there is no prospect of that happening— [ Interruption . ] Labour Members seem to forget that they are still committed in principle to joining the euro . This Government will not join the euro , but it is in our interests that the euro works .\n",

      "\t\tQuestion 1. In 2007 funds were awarded under capital expenditure grants—the Bellwin formula—to Hull and Gloucestershire . Will similar moneys be awarded to repair bridges and roads that were severely damaged in the September floods in North Yorkshire ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs made a statement dealing with the Bellwin formula and some of the flooding . I will look at the suggestion my hon Friend has made .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 2. My right hon and learned Friend will be aware that I am not a member of such an organisation and never have been . Will he also recognise that the important thing about structures of any type is that they must be sound , they must be based on what can be delivered and they must last ? In the present circumstances , it looks unlikely that any dates will ever be met .\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 2. I share my hon Friend 's approach . One of the British contributions that we can make to the discussions is to be sensible , to concentrate on the practicalities and to insist that all decisions are taken on the clearest possible basis of a judgment of what is in the interest of the European economy and then of what is in the interest of the British economy . It is absolutely essential that no economic and monetary union should take place unless there are genuinely convergent economies . Convergence matters more than any artificial timetable .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 3. Will the Minister scotch the rumours that swingeing cuts to the EHRC budget are on their way—69 % down on 2010 , apparently ? In this climate of post - Brexit racism and employment tribunal fee charges , it is needed more than ever , yet it is operating on less than the old Disability Rights Commission , which area comprises only one part of its multiple good works .\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 3. I am happy to scotch some of these rumours . When the EHRC was established in 2007 , it was done without a full understanding of what it would need from a budgetary point of view and what it would cost . Nearly 10 years later , we have a much better understanding of its running and efficiency costs , and of course it saw a reduction in function in 2013 . It has had to make significant savings , but at each stage , it has done so only after huge discussion with our Ministry , and it does not dispute that it will continue to be able to fulfil its statutory functions to the highest possible standard .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. Will the Minister order an inquiry into how the merchant bankers Schroder Wagg secretly transferred their entire Argentine loan book from London to Zurich on the day before the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands ? In view of the fact that a complete economic boycott would be far more effective than military action , why are the Government not bringing pressure to bear on unpatriotic , greedy , British bankers who are using their overseas subsidiaries to prop up the Argentine junta , or do the Tory Goverment prefer to send young men to their deaths than to offend their friends in the City ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. The hon Gentleman speaks from a position of invincible prejudice . Even assuming that the facts outlined by him relating to a well - known City merchant bank are true , they obviously occurred before any measures were introduced by the Government . The Argentine Government have complained , within the terms of the GATT , about the effctiveness of the measures and the damage that they are likely to do to the Argentine economy in the long run . That suggests that the measures have been well designed and are achieving their objective .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. The removal of high sheriffs from any rolling High Court enforcement will , as the Minister said , break the link between the high sheriff and the under - sheriff . In the past , the under - sheriff has offered the incoming high sheriff an indemnity against any litigation that might be brought by aggrieved debtors . Will the Lord Chancellor 's Department indemnify high sheriffs in any outstanding period between Royal Assent and the point when the statutory limitation becomes legally effective ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. The issue that the hon Gentleman has highlighted is one of the reasons for the change , because it was felt that it was unfair for a volunteer to be under certain legal obligations and carry such a responsibility . As for the time between Royal Assent and the continuation of the indemnity , that is certainly something that we shall look at and consult on .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 6. In March , Ministers confirmed in this place that the Department was conducting a review into the long - term funding challenges facing the charity advice sector , as was promised to me by the Prime Minister last October . Will the Minister tell the House and the busy advisers , such as those at Wiltshire ’s citizens advice bureau , what conclusions he has reached ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 6. Advice providers , like other parts of the voluntary sector , are facing a difficult funding situation . In the Budget , the Chancellor made £ 20 million available in each of the next two years to support the not - for - profit advice sector as it adapts . Our transition fund also provides support to 45 CABs and 17 law centres , and the Ministry of Justice is increasing funding for mediation services by £ 15 million to encourage greater use of mediation in disputes .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. In relation to the use of control orders , the Government 's independent reviewer of terrorist legislation last week suggested that they should instead devise a new system . Will the Home Secretary heed his advice and replace them ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. The review of counter - terrorism legislation is of course taking advice and representations from a wide variety of those who have interests in control orders and other aspects of counter - terrorism legislation . Indeed , the reviewer of counter - terrorism legislation has made his views clear to the review .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. In Wales , the common agricultural policy provides £ 200 million a year , in part to protect the long - term future of the Welsh countryside . Will the Secretary of State or one of her Ministers be meeting representatives of the Welsh Government , including the Cabinet Secretary for Environment and Rural Affairs , to ensure that EU funding to protect the Welsh environment is replaced pound for pound by the UK Government ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. The hon Gentleman will be pleased to know that I met Lesley Griffiths last week to discuss these issues , and the Secretary of State plans to meet her shortly . We intend to work very closely with all the devolved Administrations as we devise a new agriculture policy for after we leave the European Union . We recognise the importance of that to every part of the UK and will engage every part of the UK.\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. In response to my earlier question , the Secretary of State boasted that a number of firms were already benefiting from the Government ’s direct lending facility . Will he name the firms , in addition to Carillion , that have benefited to date ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. I can not name the firms , but I am happy to write to the hon Lady with the names . UK Export Finance , which she asked about , is now providing a substantial range of export finance facilities , which were not available before and are contributing substantially to export growth .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. Article 39 of Magna Carta contains the origins of our right to trial by jury . In a recent report , Sir Brian Leveson , not satisfied with undermining the right to a free press , wants to restrict the right to trial by jury . Will my right hon Friend , as long as he is Prime Minister , defend our historic rights ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 10. I am a great supporter of jury trial . I think it is one of the very important things we have in this country that safeguard people ’s rights and freedoms , and I do not want to see it reduced .\n",

      "\t\tQuestion 1. What actual progress has been made with the top three projects recommended by the northern electrification taskforce , which was chaired by the Under - Secretary of State for Transport , the hon Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough ( Andrew Jones ) ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. The report was a cross - party report from the taskforce , which was chaired by my hon Friend . Much has obviously been learned about electrification since then , but the report forms part of the foundation for deciding how we will move forward with further electrification and how we will prioritise those particular schemes .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 2. Given the state of the defence budget , the fact that we are fighting a war and the possible danger of duplication by investing sums of money in European alternatives to NATO defence structures , what possible justification can there be for spending any significant sums at all on the duplicatory European defence capability ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 2. The hon Gentleman would have to explain exactly where we have done that and where there has not been effect from European Union involvement in the operations that it has undertaken . As I said , I recently visited fleet command , where we have run Operation Atalanta without any structures and without building any unnecessary bureaucracy . We have got that operation up and running in pretty short order , under a European flag and co - operating with NATO. Why is his party so totally opposed to such effective operations ?\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 3. What measurable progress is being made in improving data sharing , not just between hospitals and general practitioners , but between the NHS and social services , to avoid bureaucracy and additional cost ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 3. My hon Friend has taken a great interest in this topic , and he is absolutely right to do so , because if we are to give integrated , joined - up care , in which people deal with NHS professionals who know about them , their medical history , their allergies and all the other important things , it is vital that , if they give their consent , their medical record can be accessed . That needs to be from GP surgery to hospital to social care system . Under the named GP policy that we have announced , there is a big opportunity for care homes to access GP records and keep them updated daily , so that GPs are kept in daily contact with how some of the most vulnerable people are doing .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. What percentage of our energy will be provided by willow coppicing , and how does that compare with the possible percentage that could be produced through encouraging the burning of waste paper and packaging ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. I can not give the hon Gentleman those figures , for the very good reason that we do not have prescriptive targets for each particular technology . There is a great deal of potential in the biomass sector , and willow coppice is only one of the sources . So far , however , very little of that potential has been fulfilled . I agree with the implication of the question , which is that waste technologies contribute more in the short term when they are counted as renewables , and they have the potential to contribute much more . I have visited a number of such plants , and I have been impressed with some of the technologies involved . We should not rule out any of the technologies , but it is extremely important that we test , sooner rather than later , some of the assumptions about whether the technologies will contribute anything of significance to the targets . We are putting a lot of money into biomass , and we want to see some return on it soon .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. Will my hon Friend reread the Pentateuch with regard to years of jubilee and debt remission and see whether it has any application to our present problems with the Third world ?\n",

      "\t\tAnswer 6. My hon Friend will know that my predecessors have successively reduced the proportion of local expenditure that is met by the rate support grant . That has been widely welcomed by many local authorities as increasing local accountability — [ Interruption . ] I am quoting what was said to me by the chairman of the Association of County Councils . The proposals which I shall discuss with the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance tomorrow provide for a small further reduction in the proportion met by the rate support grant .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. Does my right hon Friend agree that making the right investment at the right time will ensure the growth and modernisation of the NHS , the employment of more doctors , nurses and health professionals and that use remains free at the point of delivery , and that that is precisely what the electors of West Lancashire voted for on 5 May ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. I thank my hon Friend for that question , and take this opportunity to welcome her to the House of Commons and to congratulate her on her election . She has reminded the Opposition of the success of the Government 's investment in the NHS , and their catcalls in response say it all . Of course , extra investment was needed , and the Government 's approach was correct . By 2008 , we will have 80,000 more nurses , midwives and health visitors , 25,000 more doctors and 100 new hospitals . Yesterday , the shadow Chancellor did not answer the important question in respect of that investment in the NHS : does he support it , or would he reverse it ?\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. If , despite the attempts of the Government , and in the light of the election results , which were geared to the November agreement , the majority of the people in Ulster—not the United Kingdom—were determined to go for independence , what would the Government do ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. I hope that no such counsels will prevail . I think the House will recognise what an unfortunate course that would be . I have made clear our belief in the merits of the agreement , but we remain ready , willing and anxious to talk to representatives of the majority community as well . I have to say that one can not complain , as some leaders of the majority community do , about lack of consultation when they refuse to enter into any dialogue whatsoever .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. Does my right hon Friend share my concern that should a separate Scotland become a member state of the EU , a condition of membership will be an obligation to join the euro , with the further risk that that would expose Scotland to being part of a future bail - out of eurozone members ? [ Interruption . ]\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. Notwithstanding the heckling from the nationalist Benches , which hides the fact that they do not have answers to these very important questions , the point is that they used to be in favour of the euro but now they have back - tracked ; they used to be in favour of a separate currency but now they have back - tracked ; and they are currently saying that a currency union would be the best starting point . I think Scotland deserves to know what the end point would be .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. If the Prime Minister did decide to visit West Derbyshire , does she think that it would increase or reduce the 100 Tory majority ?\n",

      "\t\tQuestion 1. What could a Welsh Assembly , under a supposed Labour Government of the future , achieve that the Welsh Grand Committee can not ? Does my right hon Friend agree that the Welsh Grand Committee is a much better forum to protect and advance Welsh interests than a spurious assembly without a proper mandate ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. The Welsh Grand Committee could achieve a good deal more if the hon Member for Caerphilly ( Mr. Davies ) would agree to its having a Question Time , which is what I have been asking him to do , but certainly an assembly could not achieve very much . Opposition Members can not agree about how its members would be elected , so they can not get very far with saying what it might achieve .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 2. Does the Minister agree that , in effect , the conflict in northern Uganda is between the Islamic values of the Sudan and the Christian values of Uganda ? What we are seeing there is a microcosm of the conflict between the two religions that we find elsewhere in the world .\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 2. I had not heard that explanation of the difficulties in northern Uganda . It is a very serious and complex situation , but it would be difficult for followers of any religion to justify the terrible atrocities that the LRA has been carrying out against innocent people in northern Uganda .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 3. I thank the Minister for her answer . It is certainly worrying that the proportion of apprentices who are not receiving the apprenticeship minimum wage has increased and that one in four apprentices do not receive it . What firm and decisive action is she taking to clamp down on the rising non - compliance of employers with the apprenticeship minimum wage , especially given that the number of young people aged 16 to 18 who are starting apprenticeships has fallen ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 3. The hon Gentleman raises an issue that the Government are concerned about and are acting on . From 1 July , Her Majesty ’s Revenue and Customs has prioritised complaints about the apprenticeship minimum wage to ensure that it brings proper enforcement against employers who are not paying it . Further , we have made it much easier to name and shame employers who do not pay the minimum wage . We have also announced that we will increase the maximum penalty fine to £ 20,000 . That tough programme of enforcement action should help to ensure that businesses pay their workers properly . That is what the public expect and it is what most responsible businesses already do .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. What additional support is the Secretary of State putting in place to reduce youth unemployment so that young people have a positive future in Northern Ireland ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. The hon Gentleman has a long track record in youth issues . We are very concerned about them . This was a problem for the previous Government , of which he was not a member , in all fairness , and it continues to be a problem . The Executive are dealing with a number of issues to do with apprenticeships and youth learning and we will continue to support them in every way . It is critical , however , that Executive Ministers engage with Lord Freud on the whole proposed package of welfare reform .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. What exactly would be achieved by air strikes ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. My hon Friend enters the realm of speculation . Actions have not been ruled out : at this moment , NATO is examining all credible options . However , the resolution of the present crisis clearly lies in the hands of President Milosevic . If he does the things that I have outlined—if he makes it clear that he intends to enter into meaningful and time - limited dialogue with the Kosovar Albanians—we will be able to resolve the crisis instantly . Beyond that , I shall not stand before the House and say that we are prepared to rule out credible options at this stage .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 6. What induced the Minister to stand on its head the expansionist policy of his predecessor ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 6. The answer is simple . In June 1983 , within a few weeks of the general election , the European Council meeting in Stuttgart at last decided that the CAP should be brought back to reality and rationality . As a result of those sensible decisions , which should have been taken years earlier—if British advice had been followed they would have been taken years earlier—we have been able to return the CAP to a degree of realism .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. The Secretary of State has revealed that there are nearly 30,000 unemployed trained teachers in England . What other avenues of employment would he recommend them to seek ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. There must be an infinite number of answers to that question . The proportion of teachers unemployed is , I fear , far less than the proportion of unemployed people with other skills in the private and public sectors because of the bad state of the economy , due , in part , to excessive Labour Government spending , with its consequences on inflation , interest rates and taxation .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. The right hon Gentleman knows that many small businesses in Wales are involved in tourism . What immediate , direct compensation packages has he urged his Cabinet colleagues to provide to those businesses ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. I entirely agree with the hon Gentleman about the impact of foot and mouth disease on tourism in Wales , especially in Brecon this week . We face a tremendous problem , particularly as footpaths were reopened only a few days ago . He will know that the Government and the National Assembly are providing a joint package to help tourism businesses in Wales that includes application to the small firms loan guarantee scheme for loans up to £ 250,000 , business advice through Business Connect Wales and deferment of tax , VAT and national insurance payments . The Assembly has provided a very generous package of assistance to enable local authorities to help businesses , including those in tourism . I know that he along with everyone in Wales , accepts that there are tremendous burdens on tourism businesses in Wales .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. Our future aircraft carriers are being built by our Scottish allies . What happens to the construction of those carriers if Scotland declares independence and does not contribute to the cost ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. As a good Unionist , I must emphasise that the carriers are being built by the United Kingdom , and that many English yards , as well as Scottish yards , are making a fine contribution to these outstanding ships . The best thing that I can say to my hon Friend is that it is two thirds of a century since the United Kingdom built a warship outside the UK—that happened during the second world war—so the facts speak for themselves .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. Everyone in the Chamber will benefit this year from electricity generated by coal burnt in the Bassetlaw , West Burton and Cottam power stations . What contingency agreement has been reached with EDF to ensure that in 2026 and beyond , when we do not have enough power available , the decision to close coal - based power stations can be reversed ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 10. Can I reassure the hon Gentleman that we are moving to a consultation on ending coal - fired power stations by 2025 ? I am sure that he will want to participate in it . This Government are taking the long - term view on getting the right mix of decarbonising and having energy security . That is why we are making this plan well ahead of time—it is 10 years ahead .\n",

      "\t\tQuestion 1. May I compliment the Government on their firm stand over the MFA negotiations ? Will my hon Friend ensure that pressure is kept up throughout the GATT negotiations , and bear in mind how important the textile industry is both to Scotland and to those employed in it ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. I am grateful to my hon Friend for his kind remarks . Indeed , I know that he recently met the Minister for Trade . We are all aware of the textile industry 's importance to the Scottish economy .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 2. May I support the Minister 's efforts to reduce delayed discharges as a way of reducing cancellations ? I draw her attention to the single most effective measure that is being taken in Milton Keynes to deal with delayed discharges , which is a single social care assessment protocol agreed by social services and the NHS. May I urge her to try to make sure that a national social care assessment protocol is agreed , so that all social services and NHS personnel throughout the country can work more effectively to reduce delayed discharges ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 2. Yes , and I can also say that considerable work is being done throughout the country to improve the co - ordination between social services and the NHS. That is part of a broader modernisation programme , including an £ 8.5 million programme by the modernisation agency to cut cancelled operations .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 3. Will the Minister look at one particularly important aspect—the fact that those who suffer from long - term mental illness and require prescriptions do not enjoy the exemptions that apply to others ? Will he do that without delay ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 3. We shall certainly do so , among a raft of other measures , in conjunction with trusts and , importantly , local authorities . All too often , vulnerable people suffering from mental illness fall between the national health service and local authorities . We shall be addressing the issue as a matter of urgency .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. Over 870 young people in Telford have benefited from the new deal . Will my right hon Friend do all he can to protect that programme , and look at ways in which we can integrate it with modern apprenticeships ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. My hon Friend represents the interests of the people of Telford with great distinction . Unemployment since 1997 has fallen by half , and is 2.5 per cent . Long - term unemployment has fallen by 77 per cent . and youth unemployment by 80 per cent . All that would be put at risk if the Tories ' policy to abolish the new deal were implemented .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. Is the Minister aware that there was an inquiry into prison education by the last Select Committee on Education , and that one of the things that stood out clearly was that the very long queue of prisoners wanting education—even lifers—cannot be satisfied because of the cuts in education in the prisons ? Will he do something to help ? Will he look at some of the details of that report ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. I have read the report . However , I think the hon Gentleman will concede that a prison building programme , an increase in the number of prison officers and improved management of the prison service are more likely than anything else to enable more opportunities for study to be made available .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 6. I thank my right hon Friend for that staggering reply and draw her attention to the fact that the national lottery has meant a bonanza for my constituents , with more than £ 1.2 million spent in my constituency and the immediate surrounding region—and that achieved without any substantial fall in charitable giving for any significant charity . May I congratulate her on that excellent result ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 6. I thank my hon Friend and congratulate his constituents . He has a formidable list of charities being supported by the national lottery . They include Homestart and church and sports projects . With other hon Members , he is benefiting from the great national lottery . Contrary to expectations , the evidence is that contributions for charitable giving have not fallen .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. I congratulate my right hon Friend on his forthright recognition that one of the ways to keep senior and experienced nurses in the health service is to recognise that most of them have family responsibilities for young children or elderly relatives and that , as well as invaluable work in the NHS , they also do invaluable work at home . I draw to his attention the industrial tribunal case of Hale v. Wiltshire Health Care NHS trust in which the trust was found guilty of discriminating by changing nurses ' work patterns in such a way that they were prevented from taking their children to school . Will he ensure that all NHS managers implement his family - friendly policies ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. Yes .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. I welcome the Government ’s continued commitment to the Access to Work scheme . May I draw the Minister ’s attention to the report of the all - party parliamentary group for young disabled people , which I chair ? One of its recommendations was that the scheme should be extended to both internships and long - term voluntary work placements . Will the Minister undertake to consider that recommendation ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. The policy intent of Access to Work is to support disabled people into paid sustainable work , and as such it is not offered for unpaid internships or voluntary work . However , from 1 October this year Access to Work has been available to young disabled people undertaking work experience under the Youth Contract . I would like to meet my hon Friend to talk further about this matter .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. Does my right hon Friend agree that overcrowded school premises can inhibit a school 's excellence as much as overcrowded classes ? Will she look with special sympathy at proposals , soon to reach her , to rebuild or expand Monk Fryston Church of England primary school in my constituency ? Built for 44 children , it is now crammed with 126 of them , in more temporary classrooms than original classrooms . Will she do her best to help that marvellous school move into a more expansive phase ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. My right hon Friend has been consistently assiduous in pressing the case for a capital allocation to Monk Fryston school , and I am grateful to him . I understand that the North Yorkshire local education authority has included an element for the school in this year 's capital bid . Clearly I can give my right hon Friend no more reassurance than to say that I will judge any such bid against our criteria to ensure that resources are fairly distributed .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. I welcome the new Secretary of State to his place on behalf of Plaid Cymru and wish his predecessor well in taking on his new responsibilities , which are also of great importance . We look forward to the right hon Gentleman making some jinking runs down the left wing in the next few Question Time sessions . I draw the Secretary of State 's attention to the imminent loss of jobs at Dewhirst in Cardigan and to the rundown in Ministry of Defence facilities at Aberporth . The loss of more than 400 jobs in one small market town over the next year could , at least temporarily , double the unemployment rate in the Cardigan travel - to - work area . Will he now redouble his efforts and those of his Department—his hon Friend the Under - Secretary already knows about Aberporth—to ensure that there are more constructive debates , especially with the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Diversification Agency , about new commercial opportunities using the excellent site and resources that we have at Aberporth ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 10. Those are the first best wishes I have ever had from Plaid Cymru . I am not sure whether I should thank the hon Gentleman for them , but I shall do so in the spirit of chivalry . I acknowledge the hard work that the hon Gentleman has done on behalf of his constituents in respect of the matter that he raises . I know that he is very concerned about it and so are we . However , plans are afoot to create new opportunities in his area , including , for example , plans for a technology park at Aberporth . Those plans are still proceeding and are capable of creating more than 200 well - paid high - quality jobs . In Ceredigion , unemployment is at an all - time low ; the 2.5 per cent . claimant count is one of the lowest in Wales , thanks to this Labour Government .\n",

      "\t\tQuestion 1. I thank the Minister for that reply . Does she agree with her colleague the Minister for Children and Families that all parents should have the right to request flexible working ? Indeed , given that there are so many reasons other than caring responsibilities for people wanting to manage their work - life balance differently , does she agree that there would be benefits for all of society if the right were extended to everyone ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. My right hon Friend the Minister for Children and Families was giving her personal view on how we might build on successful policies to try to make work much more flexible for millions of people . For example , the right to request flexible working has led to 47 per cent . of new mothers working flexi - time , compared with just 17 per cent . in 2002—a massive change . From this April , as the hon Lady is , I am sure , well aware , we are extending that right to carers . I have sympathy with the view that we should go further , build on that and extend the right to other groups in due course , but we have to try to take the business community with us because the key to our success so far has been culture change and the fact that we have been able to maintain a consensus . We will of course keep the position under review .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 2. Does the hon Gentleman agree that the largest numbers of employed people in Northern Ireland are in agriculture ? Does he also agree that if the so - called remedies from Europe are applied to Northern Ireland agriculture they will have a very adverse effect on Northern Ireland 's family farms ? Will he declare the devastated areas of Northern Ireland disaster areas in order to give short - term employment ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 2. The Government have been active in remedying the damage by flooding and in assisting those people who suffered damage . On the general issues , it is not possible for Northern Ireland to stand aside from the main trend within Europe . It is necessary for this to be handled on a European Community basis rather than on a Northern Ireland basis .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 3. Does my right hon Friend agree that the long - suffering commuters of London will have no sympathy for a strike over the retention of a promotion system based on Buggins ' turn rather than ability ? Does he agree that a wage claim of £ 3,000 a year is quite extraordinary and unjustified ? Does he agree that common sense rather than greed and avarice should be the guiding light of London Transport ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 3. I agree that prolonged industrial troubles on the London Underground are extremely damaging to travellers . They will not help to resolve the problems , and the House should urge that there should not be such industrial action .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. I thank my hon Friend for that answer . Does he agree that the veterans challenge fund can play an important role in helping excellent organisations , such as the Dunscroft branch of the Royal British Legion in my constituency , at whose annual dinner I am speaking , as part of the veterans day celebrations ? Does he further agree that all hon Members have a responsibility to help to promote take - up and awareness of the veterans challenge fund , so that our most vulnerable veterans can get the support that they deserve ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. I am in the happy position of being a Minister who has money to give away . I want to make sure that more and more veterans organisations apply for funding from the challenge fund . Indeed , I spoke at the veterans forum only last week and urged more organisations to apply . I hope that Members on both sides of the House will recognise the important contribution that the challenge fund makes . There are funds available and I urge Members to look for opportunities for organisations that support the veterans agenda in their constituencies to bid for funding . The number to ring is 0800 1692277 or they can write directly to me and I will give them the address .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. I thank my right hon Friend for that reply . Does he agree that , as people will want to use their cars as part of an integrated transport strategy , it is important that those vehicles are less polluting and more fuel efficient than they are now ? Does he further agree that the development of alternative fuels , such as compressed natural gas and liquified petroleum gas , will have an important role to play in achieving that end ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. Yes , the motor car will continue to have an important role in transport , not least because it is flexible and convenient . My hon Friend is right that we want an increased take - up of alternative fuels , particularly in congested areas , to help those people , especially asthmatics , who suffer because of poor air quality caused by fuel emissions .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 6. I thank my hon Friend for that reply . Does he agree that being in work is absolutely crucial to future pensions provision ? Does he further agree that scrapping the new deal for lone parents , which has helped hundreds of lone parents in my constituency , will have a catastrophic effect on future pension provision for many women ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 6. Yes , indeed . My hon Friend 's question reminds us that what we are doing in respect of employment policy and our success in moving back towards full employment will have a crucial impact on pensions for women as well as men . The impact of giving women the opportunity to have successful careers and of providing help with child care shows that those policies are as much pension policies as the formal pension policies that we tend to discuss at Question Time .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. Does the Minister agree that closing the pay gap further means that businesses could still do more to ensure that they recruit , retain and promote the best women ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. I agree with my hon Friend . Successful businesses know that they can not afford to miss out on the talents and experiences of half our population , and the Government are working closely with business on that , especially through the Women ’s Business Council , which was established by this Government in 2012 . We are helping businesses to ensure that women can fully contribute to the country ’s economic growth .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. Does my hon Friend agree that while it makes sense to link research funding to the excellence of that research , it necessarily implies that there must be fair criteria for selecting the quality of research and a fair method of appeal for those who disagree with the category within which they have been put ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. My hon Friend makes a fair point , but I draw his attention to the fact that these judgments were not arrived at haphazardly . They were arrived at not only by the UGC , but in consultation with the Royal Society , research councils , medical charities , other learned bodies and other very distinguished individuals . Therefore , I stress that the judgments were not arrived at lightly .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. Does the Secretary of State know of the other proposals on annuities provision such as those from the Tenon group ? Does he agree that if such proposals are shown to be workable and if they would not result in loss of revenue to the Treasury , the Government should implement them as swiftly as possible ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. It is certainly true that if someone proposed a much better scheme that cost no more and gave pensioners lots more money , most Governments would consider it . I am aware of the latest proposals—indeed , I have received a copy of the letter that set them out—but I repeat the point that I made to the hon Member for Arundel and South Downs ( Mr. Flight ) . The current position is that the vast majority of those who are retiring have , on average , £ 30,000 available to purchase an annuity . Any question of drawing down a lump sum is academic , assuming that they expect to live for a reasonable number of years into retirement . I am not against change and the Government will consider alternatives if they are better , but we can not embark on a course of action that might benefit a few people , some of whom are substantially well provided for , at the expense of the majority . I ask my hon Friend to examine the implications of all those proposals , because , as with so many on the matter , one must ask where they are coming from , exactly what drives the desire to make reforms and who they would benefit .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. Does my right hon Friend agree that those on low incomes are most affected by inflation and that it ill behoves the Opposition to lecture us on either subject ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 10. That is absolutely right . For generations inflation destroyed the savings of pensioners . Above all else , we must ensure that we eradicate inflation .\n",

      "\t10 sample question-answer pairs that were assigned type 7 (26765 total questions with this type) :\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 1. One of my constituents who works 16 hours a week and is a carer for a disabled relative has discovered that because of the living wage she no longer qualifies for carer ’s allowance , leaving her with a substantial shortfall . Why on earth have this Government forced her and thousands of others into this desperate situation ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 1. We as a Government spend £ 2.3 billion a year in supporting the invaluable work that carers do in this country . The impact of the national living wage will always be reviewed .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 2. Increasingly in London , young people are finding it impossible to afford to rent or buy a home , so why , under this Government , are we seeing the lowest number of housing starts since the 1920s and a housing bubble driven by wealthy overseas buyers ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 2. On the last point , it is this Government who are introducing capital gains tax for overseas buyers—something that the Labour party did not do in 13 years . On housing , nearly 400,000 new homes have been delivered since 2010 and huge amounts of money are going into social housing . It is also this Government who are reforming the planning system , often opposed by Labour , to make all these things happen .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 3. Why attempt to build a new runway at Heathrow when we could deliver one at Gatwick in half the time , for half the cost and with a fraction of the environmental impact ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 3. I assure my right hon Friend that no decision has been taken on the site of airport expansion in the south - east . As she will know from her previous background , the Davies commission said that airport capacity in the south - east should be expanded and the Government accepted that argument . The Davies commission identified three sites , all of which it said would be credible and deliverable , and the Government will take a decision this month .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 4. The Conservative party has always claimed to be suspicious of an over - mighty state . Why , then , do the Justice Secretary ’s plans for judicial review reform strengthen the role of the state at the expense of the rights of individual citizens ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 4. I do not believe that anyone should just be able to make a case , find a lawyer and have the initial application paid for . That is what we are going to change .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 5. Why since 2011 has SME investment and lending to SMEs fallen by £ 30 billion ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 5. We have had to deal with the aftermath of a banking crisis that occurred , in part , because of failed regulation set up by the previous Government .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 6. Many jobs in my constituency , at Evesham Technology , depend on a highly successful Government scheme , the home computing initiative . Why , without warning , and only days after the Department of Trade and Industry offered it to its own staff , has the Chancellor of the Exchequer abolished it ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 6. There are , however , other things that we are putting in place to help people with improving access to technology . For example , there are now going to be some 6,000 centres across the UK which will allow people to access computer technology at very low expense . But we have to ensure that in any such initiative we obviously balance the revenue that is coming in with the support that is being given .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 7. The Government have shown themselves willing to qualify the autonomy of primary care trusts when they feel it necessary to do so . Why then are they ignoring the huge disparity between the best and worst performing primary care trusts in the drug - prescribing habits of their practitioners and the related costs ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 7. I referred to that matter when I answered the question asked by the hon Member for Gainsborough ( Mr. Leigh ) . We are drawing the attention of primary care trusts to the value of more efficient prescribing commissioning , and—as I said—generic prescribing has increased from 51 to 83 per cent . We are making excellent progress and I hope that PCTs , autonomous bodies as they are , will none the less take notice of the guidelines that the Government have issued , which will ensure that we have more efficient drug prescribing in future .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 8. Why in the past year has Britain slipped from third in the world to 13th in terms of investment in green industry ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 8. I am afraid that it will be very difficult to shake a legacy of 13 years of Labour government , and the hon Gentleman will know that we slipped massively down the table of world manufacturing during his party ’s time in government . We are having to put this country on a different trajectory , and that means a slight hiatus while we change course , but when we have changed course and our new measures are in place we will be primed for success and will turn around the miserable failure of the Labour years .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 9. Why , according to the International Monetary Fund , the OECD and the European Union , is Britain heading for a longer and deeper recession than any of its competitors ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 9. I have just cited the Institute for Fiscal Studies , which said— [ Interruption . ] They do not like hearing a statement— [ Interruption . ] First of all , our Institute for Fiscal Studies said that we would avoid a longer and deeper recession by means of the fiscal stimulus that we are taking . That is exactly the same view as has been expressed by the International Monetary Fund . I am afraid that the Conservatives are living in a dream world if they believe , one , that this is purely a British problem , and two , that the answer to it is doing nothing . They have to go back to the drawing board and think again .\n",
      "\t\tQuestion 10. Why , in monitoring public expenditure , did not the Chief Secretary disclose the large margin of error in 1981–82 until after the Budget ?\n",
      "\t\tAnswer 10. The right hon Gentleman will know from his experience that monitoring is not such as always to disclose the figures . I am as concerned as he is about why so large a change came about in such a short time . I am looking into the matter , and share his conncern about it .\n"
