      "6) Although it is arithmetically true, it is also misinformation that most of Silesia was German before 1945. All of Lower Silesia was German. Upper Silesia was divided between Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.\n",
      "7) Although it is arithmetically true, it is also misinformation that majority of population was German. Un lower Silesia was mostly German with significant Polish and Jewish minority. Upper Silesia was mostly Polish with significant German and Jewish minority. The Czech Silesia was inhabitet by the Germans, Czechs and Poles.\n",
      "8) It is not true that the German population were expelled and replaced by Poles expelled from former Kresy.\n",
      "After 1945 Upper Silesia was inhabited mainly by the same population as before, there were significant migrations, but not of ethnic reasons.\n",
      "Population in Lower Silesia was changed significantly, but is not true they were expelled. Most of the Germans escaped before the Soviets or were evacuated by the German authorities. Significant groups emigrated later. Polish authorities tried to hold them here as they wanted the labour force. There was also a group that was expelled.\n",
      "Polish population in Lower Silesia was not from Kresy. As the statistics collected in years 1945-50 show population of Lower Silesia was from various Polish regions (central, western, eastern Polsnd), from ex-Polish territoreis ceded to Soviet Union, from other parts of Soviet Union, from Germany (held as compulsory laborers there), from Western European countriies and also from Upper Silesia and some natives living in Lower Silesia before.\n",
      "9) It is very biased to mantion only expulsion of German people, and to stay silent about expulsion of Polish Silesians by Bismarck and Hitler. It is also very strange to stay silent about killing Silesian Poles and Jews during WWII.\n",

Loo, c'est fait expres, pour nous faire réagir, pour mettre en évidence nos faiblesses, nos erreurs, ne t y trompes pas. Regarde d'au dessus, essaye de t abstraire. Regarde et analyse la démarche. Lis attentivement la page NPOV test, surtout la fin. La dernière série sur \"comment faire taire un adversaire\" est passionnante. Regarde bien aussi la liste d'extrait de point de vue sur le NPOV  tu réaliseras que nous ne parlons pas de la même chose, nous tous. Il y a aussi des pistes de résolution de conflit a explorer. Vois l'épreuve comme un apprentissage. Je suis assez optimiste pour ma version. Elle changera bien sur, il manque encore des choses, mais sur le fond, je suis assez sure de moi.
